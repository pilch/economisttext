The episodes include the 1929 stock market crash, the 1973 oil shock, the 2007 U.S. subprime collapse and fifteen severe post-World War II financial crises. The focus is not on the immediate antecedents and aftermath of these events but on longer horizons that compare decades rather than years. While evidence of lost decades, as in the depression of the 1930s, 1980s Latin America and 1990s Japan are not ubiquitous, GDP growth and housing prices are significantly lower and unemployment higher in the ten-year window following the crisis when compared to the decade that preceded it. Inflation is lower after 1929 and in the post-financial crisis decade episodes but notoriously higher after the oil shock. We present evidence that the decade of relative prosperity prior to the fall was importantly fueled by an expansion in credit and rising leverage that spans about 10 years; it is followed by a lengthy period of retrenchment that most often only begins after the crisis and lasts almost as long as the credit surge.// El presente art\u00edculo examina el comportamiento del PIB real (montos y tasas de crecimiento), el desempleo, la inflaci\u00f3n, el cr\u00e9dito bancario y los precios de los bienes ra\u00edces a lo largo de un periodo de 21 a\u00f1os en torno de una serie de importantes sucesos y choques adversos, tanto globales como espec\u00edficos por pa\u00eds.

Not surprisingly, banking crises are associated with profound declines in output and employment. The unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four years. Output falls an average of over 9 percent, although the duration of the downturn is considerably shorter than for unemployment. The real value of government debt tends to explode, rising an average of 86 percent in the major post\u2013World War II episodes. The main cause of debt explosions is usually not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing the banking system. The collapse in tax revenues in the wake of deep and prolonged economic contractions is a critical factor in explaining the large budget deficits and increases in debt that follow the crisis.

The Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias (CEEY) brought together a group of experts in financial systems and public finance to debate the origin of the above-mentioned financial crises and the viability of means for anticipating them. This is particularly important since the environment in which we now find ourselves is one where technical advances and financial innovations are themselves a source of risk; this is because the speed of development often outstrips the capacity of regulators and financial supervisors to keep abreast of them. The experts also analyzed the responses of the respective authorities to the two crises, their effectiveness and alternative strategies that might have been applied.

Changes in the federal funds rate have no systematic effect on either long-term interest rates or housing prices over nearly a century. Indeed, since the mid-1990s the policy rate had a negative relationship with long-term interest rates.

Our main findings are: First, the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging economies. Second, emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt (public and private)--which is usually denominated in a foreign currency. When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Third, there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced countries as a group (some countries, such as the United States, have experienced higher inflation when debt/GDP is high.)

Nuestro examen de los registros hist\u00f3ricos m\u00e1s extensos encuentra asombrosas similitudes, tanto cuantitativas como cualitativas, con 18 crisis financieras en pa\u00edses industrializados durante la temprana posguerra. En particular, la aceleraci\u00f3n de los precios de las acciones y de las viviendas en EEUU (que la literatura sobre crisis financieras destaca como el mejor indicador l\u00edder para pa\u00edses que experimentan grandes entradas de capitales,) sigue muy de cerca el promedio verificado en las primeras crisis. Otra similitud importante es la forma en V invertida adoptada por la curva de crecimiento de la producci\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, a medida que la econom\u00eda se enfriaba en v\u00edsperas de la crisis. Entre los otros indicadores, la aceleraci\u00f3n de la deuda p\u00fablica estadounidense est\u00e1 algo por debajo del promedio de otros episodios; la inflaci\u00f3n pre-crisis tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 en un nivel inferior. Por otro lado, la trayectoria de su d\u00e9ficit en cuenta corriente es peor que el promedio. Una pregunta cr\u00edtica es si la crisis estadounidense resultar\u00e1 ser similar a las m\u00e1s severas crisis de los pa\u00edses industrializados, en cuyo caso el crecimiento podr\u00eda caer significativamente por debajo de la tendencia durante un per\u00edodo prolongado. \u00bfO resultar\u00e1 ser similar a los episodios m\u00e1s leves, en los que la recuperaci\u00f3n fue relativamente r\u00e1pida?
