On the basis of the open innovation model, policy makers are also increasingly stimulating SMEs to develop their exploration skills. In the Netherlands, a government subsidy called the \u2018innovation voucher programme\u2019 was introduced to stimulate SMEs to develop innovation in cooperation with knowledge institutes. Yet, although many studies show that SMEs tend to have a higher R&amp;D; productivity than larger firms, and innovative SMEs are more likely to make external networks with other SMEs or institutions such as universities, there is still little examination of the successfulness of SME\u2019s innovation activities. The growing policy attention for the role of SMEs in innovation prompts the questions how innovation in SMEs can be facilitated, and which factors contribute to the success (or failure) of their innovation efforts. This study explores the innovation strategy of innovative Dutch SMEs by means of their sources of innovation, innovation capabilities, innovation performance, and commercialization sources. By means of structural equation modelling of a sample of 243 Dutch SMEs, this study shows that exploring (technology) opportunity together with institutions such as universities and private research establishments is important for successful innovation in SMEs. But, in addition, our model shows that contacts with competitors are also important for successful innovation performance. Our finding that openness of open innovation also applies to the commercialization phase is too often neglected by researchers and policy makers.

The economic evaluation of this policy change has generally shown favourable outcomes in terms of consumer welfare. These welfare effects may be termed market internal effects, as they reflect the welfare consequences of transactions that take place in the market. However, aviation typically affects welfare through both market internal and external effects: these external effects usually take the form of external costs resulting from aircraft noise, emission of pollutants and accidents. This is true for both regulated and deregulated markets, but the importance of the external costs relative to the welfare total is likely to differ between regulatory regimes. This article seeks to analyze how the presence of external costs affects the welfare effect of the liberalization of airline markets.

In recent years, however, the increasing availability of large databases on real estate transactions and listed prices has opened up new research possibilities and has reduced various existing barriers to applications of conventional (spatial) hedonic analysis to the real estate market. The present paper provides one of the first applications using a spatial autoregressive model to investigate the impact of cultural heritage\u2014in particular, listed buildings and historic\u2013cultural sites (or historic landmarks)\u2014on the value of real estate in cities. In addition, this paper suggests a novel way of specifying the spatial weight matrix\u2014only prices of sold houses influence current price\u2014in identifying the spatial dependency effects between sold properties. The empirical application in the present study concerns the Dutch urban area of Zaanstad, a historic area for which over a long period of more than 20 years detailed information on individual dwellings, and their market prices are available in a GIS context. In this paper, the effect of cultural heritage is analysed in three complementary ways. First, we measure the effect of a listed building on its market price in the relevant area concerned. Secondly, we investigate the value that listed heritage has on nearby property. And finally, we estimate the effect of historic\u2013cultural sites on real estate prices. We find that, to purchase a listed building, buyers are willing to pay an additional 26.9 %, while surrounding houses are worth an extra 0.28 % for each additional listed building within a 50-m radius. Houses sold within a conservation area appear to gain a premium of 26.4 % which confirms the existence of a \u2018historic ensemble\u2019 effect.

A novelty of the paper is to combine a method of hidden cointegrations with a method of removing cross-sectional dependence. After correcting for hidden cointegrations and cross-sectional dependence, both statistical methods used yield almost similar results and confirm the presence of cointegration for the relevant data on Finnish regions.

En base a un conjunto amplio de datos econ\u00f3micos sobre regiones finlandesas, se pone a prueba la existencia de cointegraci\u00f3n utilizando m\u00c3\u00a9todos estad\u00c3\u00adsticos alternativos, tales como, el ensayo basado en residuales y el modelo condicional de correcci\u00f3n de errores. Una de las novedades del estudio es que combina un m\u00c3\u00a9todo de cointegraciones ocultas con un m\u00c3\u00a9todo de eliminaci\u00f3n de dependencia cruzada. Despu\u00c3\u00a9s de hacer correcciones para las cointegraciones ocultas y la dependencia cruzada, ambos m\u00c3\u00a9todos estad\u00c3\u00adsticos producen resultados casi similares y confirman la presencia de cointegraci\u00f3n en los datos oportunos sobre regiones finlandesas.

General characteristics of models to be used for sustainable development are discussed. It turns out that such models do not exist. Short critical descriptions are given of representative analytical models that have arisen in theories on economic growth with renewable and nonrenewable resources, and pollution, or that provide an interesting alternative view of economic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d environmental interactions. These models appear to provide incomplete descriptions of economic, ecological, and interactive processes. To clarify the logic and special features of the general model, three issues are addressed. First, a general ecological model is proposed that is consistent with a macroeconomic system in terms of geographical coverage. Such a general model would have to be able to deal with a specific set of general functions and characteristics of ecological systems. Second, the meaning of some economic, ecological, and physical concepts for modelling is discussed. Third, the potential for inclusion of sustainable development conditions is examined. Next, the general structure of an economic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ecological model for sustainable development is presented. It includes the general ecological model, descriptions of economic activities and dynamics, material and economic balances, constraints, and behavioural feedback mechanisms related to sustainable development conditions. It is shown how concern for the well-being of future generations can be included. Simulation is used to obtain insight into the behaviour of the system under different policies and scenarios. Several environmental policies can be studied, including waste treatment, recycling, research and development, and environmental cleaning. Resource use strategies may include sustainable use and specific division of extraction between renewable and nonrenewable resources. Resource-use and waste-emission strategies may be based on variable degrees of concern for future generations. The relevance of this model is that it allows for a study of the medium-term and long-term dynamic economic and environmental consequences of sustainable development conditions and variable degrees of concern for future generations.

The empirical analysis is based on an extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio traffic information and variable message sign information. The results confirm earlier findings that women are less likely to be influenced by traffic information. New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio traffic information and variable message sign information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio traffic information are positively related to route choice adaptations based on variable message sign information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic traffic information. As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips.

Modern telecommunication technology brings attractive tourist destinations directly into the living rooms of potential travellers, also destinations that would otherwise have been difficult to find, such as certain cultural heritage objects. In this contribution, we will address the relevance of e-services in urban cultural tourism. Its aim is to map out the relative drivers of cultural visitors to cities with a particular view on the importance of modern e-services in the tourist sector. We focus on three case-study cities: Amsterdam, Leipzig and Genoa. We use discrete choice models and factor analysis to analyse the preferences of tourists for cultural heritage and e-services.

This study aims to offer a historical review of key ecological and economic concepts that are essential in building bridges between ecology and economics, and discusses ways to integrate them. In addition to such issues as biodiversity indices or ecosystem management principles, particular attention is given to various monetary valuation approaches and methods from the perspective of preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of ecological and value indicators in integrated economic-ecological modelling and analysis is addressed as well.

First, we compute the equilibrium physical to creative capital ratios and the relationships between the neutral productivity shifters and the output prices. Second, we show that agricultural and services consumption are a constant multiple of manufacturing consumption. Third, we note that under certain conditions, an equilibrium in which all sectors of our urban economy grow at a constant rate does not exist.

This paper uses a simple model to illustrate how technological change can be endogenised in macroeconomic theories of growth and then surveys how - through factor mobility, the diffusion of innovations and trade - spatial interdependence in a system of regions can influence technological change and growth. Endogenous technological change generates in our illustrative model long-run steady-state growth in a closed economy. However, it turns out that the dynamic impact of spatial interdependence depends on the specification of the model. Spatial convergence, a steady state with persisting spatial differences in growth rates and unstable growth are all theoretically possible.

This paper identifies the role of cultural diversity in explaining spatial disparities in wages and housing prices across Dutch cities, using unique individual panel data of home owners. We distinguish between the effects of interactions-based productivity, consumption amenities and sorting of heterogeneous home owners while controlling for interactions between the labor and housing market. We find that an increase in the cultural diversity of the population positively impacts equilibrium wages and housing prices, particularly in the largest and most densely populated cities. This result is largely driven by spatial sorting of individuals in both the labor and housing market. After controlling for home owner heterogeneity we find that increasing cultural diversity no longer impacts local labor markets and negatively impacts local housing markets.

In this scheme the economic aspects of living standards are represented by various categories of consumption expenditure, whilst the social aspects are represented by appropriate indicators of health, education, labour market conditions, etc. The framework proposed is also appealing for convergence analyses over time. From a time perspective, introducing this joint socio-economic concept into the analysis of differences among countries allows one to disentangle the notion of convergence into its economic and social dimensions. An empirical analysis is conducted on the Italian regions for the period from 1980 to 2005. The empirical results obtained by Principal Component Analysis show that, on average, a high level of economic welfare may contrast with a high level of social well-being.

They play a pivotal role in the future of an urbanized Europe, but they are also confronted with grand challenges, notably far-reaching demographic transformations, environmental decay and climatological change, unequal social participation and ever-rising mobility trends. The challenges for urban environments may be turned into new opportunities, in particular, in such domains as advanced infrastructure and logistic systems, environmental and climate-neutral facilities, creative and knowledge-intensive strategies for socio-economic prosperity and well-being. Cities\u2014and in particular metropolitan areas\u2014may thus act as spearheads of sustainable economic growth for European countries. These observations call for appropriate long-range policy strategies for metropolitan areas\u2014and networks of cities\u2014in the highly diversified European space-economy.

The performance of neural network analysis needs to be carefully judged, however, since the theoretical underpinning of neuro-computing is still weakly enveloped. In the present paper we will use the logit model as a benchmark for evaluating the result of neural network models, based on an empirical case study from Italy. The present paper aims to assess the foreseeable impact of the high-speed train in Italy, by investigating competition effects between rail and road transport modes. Two statistical models will then be compared, viz. the traditional logit model and a new technique for information processing, viz. the feedforward neural network model. In the study two different cases - corresponding to a different set of attributes - are investigated, namely by using only `time' attributes and by using both `time' and `cost' attributes. From an economic viewpoint, both models appear to highlight the advantage of introducing the high-speed train system in that they show high probabilities of choosing the improved rail transport mode. The feedforward neural net model seems to provide reasonable predictions compared to those obtained by means of a logit model. An important lesson however, is that it is important to define properly the neural network architecture and to train sufficiently the network during the learning phase.

The growing importance of ICT in daily life, business activities and governance prompts the need to consider the role of ICT more explicitly in urban administrations and policies. What are the city-makers' expectations of ICT? And how do they assess the future implications of ICT for their city? An analysis of these questions is needed to provide us with a better understanding of the extent to which urban authorities are willing to invest in, and to adopt, ICT policy. This paper offers both a conceptual and an operational model that aims to map out the causes and implications of ICT perceptions and views of urban policy-makers and/or administrative officials (denoted as urban front-liners). This is followed by the presentation of an operational path model-i.e. a linear structural equations model (Lisrel). The model serves to describe and test the relationships between perceptions of the city, policy-makers' beliefs about ICT and the associated urban ICT policy. According to the model, respondents who perceive their city as having many urban functions (such as commercial centre, service centre, higher education centre) have more awareness of various ICT tools and are likely to consider a multiplicity of ICT measures as relevant to their city. Respondents who consider their city as having severe bottlenecks (such as traffic congestion, housing shortage) are less likely to think of ICT measures and ICT-related goals as relevant to their city, and nor do they think that the municipality impacts significantly on ICT in the city. Furthermore, respondents who perceive their city as suffering from many socioeconomic problems (unemployment, ageing population, industrial decline and so on) are likely to consider many ICT tools as relevant to their city, although they have a low awareness of the specific tools to be deployed. Finally, respondents who believe that ICT will significantly (and positively) affect the city and its administration also tend to believe that the municipality has a high municipal influence on ICT and consider many ICT initiatives as relevant to their city.", "authors": ["epni111"], "abstractStem": "inform and commun technolog ict have becom import tool to promot and achiev a varieti of public goal and polici the grow import of ict in daili life busi activ and govern prompt the need to consid the role of ict more explicitli in urban administr and polici what are the citymak expect of ict and how do they assess the futur implic of ict for their citi an analysi of these question is need to provid us with a better understand of the extent to which urban author are will to invest in and to adopt ict polici thi paper offer both a conceptu and an oper model that aim to map out the caus and implic of ict percept and view of urban policymak andor administr offici denot as urban frontlin thi is follow by the present of an oper path modeli a linear structur equat model lisrel the model serv to describ and test the relationship between percept of the citi policymak belief about ict and the associ urban ict polici accord to the model respond who perceiv their citi as have mani urban function such as commerci centr servic centr higher educ centr have more awar of variou ict tool and are like to consid a multipl of ict measur as relev to their citi respond who consid their citi as have sever bottleneck such as traffic congest hous shortag are less like to think of ict measur and ictrel goal as relev to their citi and nor do they think that the municip impact significantli on ict in the citi furthermor respond who perceiv their citi as suffer from mani socioeconom problem unemploy age popul industri declin and so on are like to consid mani ict tool as relev to their citi although they have a low awar of the specif tool to be deploy final respond who believ that ict will significantli and posit affect the citi and it administr also tend to believ that the municip ha a high municip influenc on ict and consid mani ict initi as relev to their citi", "title": "Modelling ICT Perceptions and Views of Urban Front-liners"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fan/scresc/vhtml10.3280-scre2015-001008.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epni111"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Invisible Cities: the End of the Urban Century?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/transp/v26y2003i1p69-103.html": {"abstract": "  This article considers the development of the international transport sector based on four globalization scenarios.

However, there are still distinct aspects that often make investment in transport infrastructure unattractive to private parties. This paper elucidates the characteristics of investments in infrastructure in general, with the aim to clarify the hesitation of private investors. One specific category of infrastructure investments, viz. container terminals, is discussed here as an interesting case. European container terminals are mostly financed with a strong involvement of private parties. From a comparative study between investments in container terminals and other investments in infrastructure, we argue that the terminal market has several features (such as imperfect competition), which lead to a lower risk for private parties. Because of these characteristics, public-private partnerships occur rather often and seem to be attractive. A situation of a fully competitive terminal market without government intervention is in the long-run possible and clearly more realistic than in other infrastructure markets. It should be realised however, that a common European policy is required to avoid distortion of competition among ports due to different subsidy regimes.International Journal of Maritime Economics (2002) 4, 1\u201320 doi: 10.1057/palgrave.ijme.9100029", "authors": ["epni111", "epri130"], "abstractStem": "the desir to creat a more competit market base transport system ha led to the involv of the privat sector in infrastructur invest howev there are still distinct aspect that often make invest in transport infrastructur unattract to privat parti thi paper elucid the characterist of invest in infrastructur in gener with the aim to clarifi the hesit of privat investor one specif categori of infrastructur invest viz contain termin is discuss here as an interest case european contain termin are mostli financ with a strong involv of privat parti from a compar studi between invest in contain termin and other invest in infrastructur we argu that the termin market ha sever featur such as imperfect competit which lead to a lower risk for privat parti becaus of these characterist publicpriv partnership occur rather often and seem to be attract a situat of a fulli competit termin market without govern intervent is in the longrun possibl and clearli more realist than in other infrastructur market it should be realis howev that a common european polici is requir to avoid distort of competit among port due to differ subsidi regimesintern journal of maritim econom 2002 4 1 20 doi 101057palgraveijme9100029", "title": "Investments in Container Terminals: Public Private Partnerships in Europe"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/anresc/v24y1990i4p237-52.html": {"abstract": " Barriers are defined as discontinuties in the broadly defined marginal costs of communications, usually leading to a discontinuity in interaction.

The explanatory framework deployed for the identification of these qualitative success factors for distinct ethnic groups is based on a particular, recently developed artificial intelligence method, viz. rough set analysis. This multidimensional classification approach appears to be able to identify various important factors for the motivation and performance of ethnic enterprises.

Rising incomes, more leisure time, new technologies and the ageing of the population are just a few examples of trends that will influence the future development of the transport sector in terms of both passenger and freight transport. This means that the future of the transport sector is characterized by uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to map out the possible impacts of current globalization trends on the European transport sector in terms of transport flows and carbon dioxide emissions by means of a novel multilayer assessment model. By applying a scenario approach and designing four contrasting development paths seen from a European perspective, the alternative futures of the sector are assessed in terms of transport volumes and emissions. The empirical findings appear to result almost everywhere in a (strong) growth of transport and emissions. Hence, the intriguing research question is now whether the introduction of specific environmentally benign policies in Europe could change this development. Consequently, the paper confronts the foreseen EU objectives with current policies, as creating sustainable mobility is a key element in EU transport policy. Our findings indicate, however, that the achievement of sustainable mobility is rather problematic. Effective policy implementation and (as yet uncertain) new technology developments may offer new opportunities to achieve a more balanced development of the transport sector.

Nowadays, both public and private actors aim to exploit the expected benefits of ICT developments. The authors seek to investigate the potential of ICT use at an urban level and, in particular, to shed more light on various factors that influence urban ICT policies in the public domain. First, a conceptual framework, designed to improve understanding of the driving forces of urban ICT policies, is outlined. It focuses on the way decisionmakers perceive their city, and shape their opinions about ICT; it addresses in particular the way these decisionmakers evaluate the importance of ICT for their city. Next, interviews with urban decisionmakers in different European cities in three countries (Austria, Spain, and the Netherlands) are used to analyse the complex relationship between perceived urban characteristics (for example, nature of problems and urban image), personal attitudes towards ICT, administrative features of the cities concerned, and perceptions of the relevance of ICT to the cities. The authors' main focus is on the identification of a possible systematic relationship between the aforementioned explanatory factors and urban decisionmakers' attitudes towards ICT policies. Understanding the decisionmakers' perceptions is an important step towards grasping the nature and substance of the policy itself, and may explain some of the variance among different cities. Because the 'urban ICT' discourse is still relatively new, an open-interview method is used to capture a variety of different views and perceptions on ICT and on the information age in the city. With the aid of qualitative content analysis, the interview results are transformed into a more systematic and tlsb&gt;comparable form. The results suggest that even interviewees from the same city may have a different understanding of their urban reality whereas, on the other hand, cities with different characteristics may appear to suffer from similar problems.

Our objective is to examine the conditions under which we can observe a relocation of firms from an urban location to a new extra-urban location. Our methodological framework is based on the model of monopolistic competition, which examines the economic relationships among firms at each industrial location and the relationships among distinct firms at different locations. These intrarelationships and interrelationships are examined according to the concept of complementarity. Complementarity in our case combines the notions of (1) firm interaction with cumulative and reinforcing effects, and (2) coordination among firms in local industrial structures. Our interest in this notion stems from the necessity to explain the spatial distribution of firms, particularly the reason why and where firms choose to locate in clusters.

A plea is made for planning for preservation of the cultural heritage by emphasizing the intangible attributes of urban monuments. In this context, the notion of option value plays an important role. The actual compound evaluation of cultural monuments, based on both user value and option value, is then undertaken by means of a recently developed multicriteria technique for qualitative assessment, namely the regime method.

In the present paper the main area of analysis is the concept of network externalities and its interpretation from a theoretical, conceptual and empirical point of view. A conceptual framework is built on the proposition that network externalities are one of the decisive reasons for entering a telecommunication network. Since externality mechanisms arise at the user side and impact on the demand function, they can be labelled \u201cconsumption network externalities\u201d. However, this paper goes a step further than the recent literature by claiming that telecommunication networks are not only governed by consumption network externalities, but also generate production network externalities, since their advantages may be measured in terms of the performance of firms and regions. The paper presents a conceptual model on the role network externality plays on the performance of firms and regions, a methodology to measure these externalities at an empirical level and the results of the empirical analysis developed in Italy. Strong regional variations in the way network externalities are exploited emerge from the empirical analysis. CAPELLO R. et NIJKAMP P. (1996).

Un cadre conceptuel est etabli a partir de la proposition que les effets externes en reseaux constituent l'un des facteurs decisifs qui expliquent la participation a un reseau de telecommunications. Vu que les mecanismes des effets externes se font sentir cote usager et influent sur la fonction de demande, on peut les cataloguer comme effets externes de consommation en reseaux.

Analytical research into the nature (with a main distinction according to run and fun shopping) and the spatial market area of a particular shopping centre located in Greater Rotterdam (Alexandrium) shows that the anticipated policy goals are met, in the sense that the shopping mall concerned turns into a regional market for run shopping purposes rather than into a competing fun shopping centre.

Based on these assumptions, a search model is constructed and the optimality conditions are derived.  One of main conclusions based on the search model is that the effect of factors which cause housing market imperfections (viz. the residential moving costs and the residence arrival rate) have ambiguous effects on he job acceptance and job search behaviour of employed individuals. For some interesting cases however, the effect of the residential moving costs on the job acceptance behaviour can be derived. In contrast, the effect of housing market imperfections on the labour market behaviour of nonemployed persons is determined.

The expected benefits from ICT encourage urban policy-makers to formulate proper strategies for public ICT policies. But, what are the urban policy-makers' expectations about ICT?

The attention is focused on regional tourist multipliers which measure the effects of tourist expenditure on the economy of a given area. On the basis of a varied sample of studies on tourist multipliers, differences among tourist income multipliers are ex post examined. The preliminaries of this investigation are discussed in order to elucidate some important issues meta-analysis may be confronted with. In addition, the results of the comparative analysis of previous studies are transferred to the Greek island of Lesvos.

(2003) Entrepreneurship in a modern network economy, Reg. Studies 37 , 395-405. In this survey paper the literature on entrepreneurship is summarized from the perspective of geographical seedbed conditions and network constellations. We argue that in many cases urban areas offer favourable incubator conditions for innovative entrepreneurship, as a result of economies of density and the opportunities created by the city as a nucleus of a broader network, both local and global. Clearly, network participation by creative entrepreneurs does not necessarily need an urban base, although informal spatial networks among specific business segments (e.g. ethnic niches) may be favourable for economic performance. We conclude that a modern entrepreneur tends to become increasingly a creative network operator and manager. N IJKAMP P. (2003) L'esprit d'entrepise dans une economie de reseau moderne, Reg.

These questions show up everywhere in the public domain, for instance, in the provision of medical facilities, the operation of postal services, or the supply of public transport. A standard tool to judge the efficiency of such agencies is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In the past years, much progress has been made to extend this approach in various directions. Examples are the Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) model and the Context-Dependent (CD) model. The DFM model is based on a generalized distance friction function and serves to improve the performance of a Decision Making Unit (DMU) by identifying the most appropriate movement towards the efficiency frontier surface. Standard DEA models use a uniform proportional input reduction (or a uniform proportional output increase) in the improvement projections, but the DFM approach aims to enhance efficiency strategies by introducing a weighted projection function. The present paper will first offer a new integrated DEA tool \u2013 emerging from a blend of the DFM and CD model using the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) method - in order to design a stepwise efficiency-improving projection model for a conventional DEA.

Although it is a first-best instrument in theory, it is argued that the assumptions needed to arrive at this conclusion oversimplify reality. In practice, congestion pricing is a second-best instrument with some advantages over other second-best instruments, but it will also give rise to numerous problems, as discussed in the paper. These problems will be illustrated with the Dutch attempts to implement an electronic road-pricing system. Some research issues relating to congestion pricing have been overlooked in the past. In the first instance, the behavioural side (motorists' responses) of congestion pricing has not been paid much attention. In general, it is argued that individuals are aiming to maximise utility (or minimise travel time). However, there seems to be an increasing recognition that this assumption does not properly describe reality. Second, the impact of the compensation scheme -- used to compensate drivers who are worse off under congestion pricing -- on the behavioural responses should be analysed more carefully in future work. This scheme might partly reverse the behavioural responses induced. Third, the welfare-generating properties of simple schemes should be looked at in future work. Fourth, given the potential opposition, we conclude that a cordon system, in which the price is dependent on the time of the day, is currently the most attractive option for pursuing a kind of congestion pricing.

In recent publications both the scientific basis and the policy relevance of this concept have been given ample attention, while also much empirical work has been undertaken to assess the value of the ecological footprint in different regions or countries of the world. The paper starts with a concise critical overview of the current discussion on ecological footprints. Its main aim, however, is to provide a meta-analytic assessment and interpretation of the various empirical findings in the recent literature that offer estimated values or ranges of the ecological footprint indicator. The sensitivity of ecological footprints for the stringent assumptions made in the calculation schemes is investigated using frequency analyses, cross- tabulation methods and decision-tree induction methods (a recent technique based on pattern recognition methods). The results show that methodological choice, geographical scales and year of data collection offer a significant explanation for variations in results.

interrelated partly due to their relative locations. Similar economic performance among regions can be attributed to proximity. Consequently, a proper understanding, and accounting, of spatial liaisons is needed in order to effectively forecast regional economic variables. Several spatial econometric techniques are available in the literature, which deal with the spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in geographically referenced data. The experiments carried out in this article are concerned with the analysis of the SAC observed for unemployment rates in 439 NUTS-3 German districts. The authors employ a semiparametric approach\u2014spatial filtering\u2014in order to uncover spatial patterns that are consistently significant over time. The authors first provide a brief overview of the spatial filtering method and illustrate the data set. Subsequently, they describe the empirical application carried out: that is, the spatial filtering analysis of regional unemployment rates in Germany. Furthermore, the authors exploit the resulting spatial filter as an explanatory variable in a panel modeling framework.

We argue that these benefits are not randomly offered to employees, but depend on the job applicants' commuting costs. The firms' choice between these benefits affects the workers' incentive to move their residence closer to the workplace. Using information on firms' recruitment behavior in the United Kingdom, this paper shows empirically that the applicants' journey-to-work time induces firms to offer these benefits to job applicants. The implications of transport-related fringe benefits for commuting and relocation are found to be rather distinct. Transport benefits make employees less sensitive to the costs of commuting, whereas relocation benefits induce employees to move closer to the workplace.

It aims to offer both a general analysis framework and a test on innovation data from several European cities. This framework is mainly built on the product life-cycle and the incubation approach. On the basis of this framework, it is argued that the phases of an industrial life-cycle have several firm-specific effects. First, these phases influence innovativeness and thus profit levels, output and employment of firms in a spatially distinct way. Second, the phases of the life-cycle mirror the importance of local factors for innovations, and third, they affect strategic decisions of firms, inter alia by influencing the source of the competitive edge. Furthermore, this paper also aims to model effects of relevant local factors on innovativeness bymeans of logit analysis, subsequent to a qualitative impact approach based on the recently developed rough set analysis. Our empirical results from various European cities show that the successive phases of the industrial life-cycle tend to create spatially recognizable impacts on innovativeness of firms.Accordingly, the evolution of the importance of local factors for innovations is also found to reflect a distinct time path. Among more than 20 local factors, the interviewed firms appear to consider support measures for skills training particularly important for innovations.

Since the late 1990s an increasing number of trade studies have taken infrastructure into account. The purpose of the present paper is to quantify the importance of infrastructure for trade by means of meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques that synthesize various studies. The type of infrastructure that we focus on is mainly public infrastructure in transportation and communication. We examine the impact of infrastructure on trade by means of estimates obtained from 36 primary studies that yielded 542 infrastructure elasticities of trade. We explicitly take into account that infrastructure can be measured in various ways and that its impact depends on the location of the infrastructure. We estimate several meta-regression models that control for observed heterogeneity in terms of variation across different methodologies, infrastructure types, geographical areas and their economic features, model specifications, and publication characteristics. Additionally, random effects account for between-study unspecified heterogeneity, while publication bias is explicitly addressed by means of the Hedges model. After controlling for all these issues we find that a 1 percent increase in own infrastructure increases exports by about 0.6 percent and imports by about 0.3 percent.

We find that innovation in both countries is predominantly determined by establishment size and industry. Moreover, obstacles encountered and organizational changes faced by firms drive innovation too. With respect to the composition of employment, the presence of high-skilled staff is most important. Cultural diversity of employees has a positive partial correlation with product innovation. The size and statistical significance of this effect depends on the econometric model specification and the country considered.

However, the operational significance of such approaches is still rather limited and a rigorous statistical-econometric treatment of nonlinear dynamic modeling experiments is lacking.

This provokes the question whether financing of infrastructure should be a task of the government. For this purpose, the paper first presents a concise theoretical overview under which cir\u00adcumstances there is a case for public intervention. Interestingly, the financing and operation of transport infrastructure has not always been the task of the public sector. In the 19th century, the railway infras\u00adtructure in Europe was financed and operated by the private sector. Later, the government took over more and more responsibilities. This paper analyses there\u00adfore the reasons for the Dutch government to take over the financing of infrastruc\u00adture, in order to draw conclusions for the present and the future. Also in the 20th century many European projects have been privately finan\u00adced. In the third part of the paper an overview is presented of several projects (e.g., Channel Tunnel, Mont Blanc Tunnel, Dartford Bridge, Dutch tunnels, Store-belt.) as well as an analysis of the circumstances under which these are economi\u00adcally successful and politically feasible. It is concluded that the influence of governments will - and should- remain substantial because of economic, political and environmental reasons. However, (some degree of) private financing is an interesting option for transport infrastruc\u00adture in various cases.

Next, we address sustainability issues as a common umbrella for the relationship \u2018economy-transportation\u2019. In this context, we show that the German production system is faced with negative environmental externalities, which are clearly associated with a specific transport mode, viz. the private car. Negative environmental externalities as a result of modal choices in Germany are confirmed by data from EU-15 countries. Public transport, in particular the train, appears to be more environmentally-benign. Our results bring to light that, on average, commuter flows have a positive and robust effect on employment in the receiving German labour market districts, while, for commuting flows, public transport, especially the train, is a more environmentally-benign mode of transport, compared with the car, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.

However, the successful exploitation of ATT in European transport markets depends on the technology being implemented in a way which meets the distinct needs of the different road user groups in order to achieve social acceptance and thereby political approval. It is therefore vitally important that decision makers (i.e. those influencing the adoption of ATT) have sufficient information on the needs of (commercial) road users and on the way they perceive ATT options in addressing those needs. The ATT market comprises a large number of actors from both the public and the private sector. At the demand side, some major potential market sectors can be identified. In addition to private users, there are intermediate or collective users (e.g., road authorities) and commercial users (e.g., the freight sector). In the latter case ATT may play a strategic role by facing the need of the freight sector to orient itself towards the opportunities offered by the European internal market, which has far-reaching impacts not only on organisations operating in international networks, but also on those operating nationally. The aim of the underlying study is to investigate the potential ATT market among these main user and interest groups, where the range of telematics applications will be restricted to those applied to inter-urban road transport. The focus will be on collective users (road managers) and commercial users (road freight operators).

On the supply side of the market, landlords are looking for households to occupy their vacant dwellings.

For many countries, an inverse relationship between wages and local unemployment rates has been found. In their book, The Wage Curve, Blanchflower and Oswald argued that the unemployment elasticity of pay is around - 0.1 in most countries. In a 1995 literature survey, Card referred to this striking empirical regularity as being close to an 'empirical law of economics'. Nonetheless, reported elasticities do vary, even excluding outliers, between about - 0.5 and + 0.1. There is also considerable heterogeneity among wage curve studies in terms of data and model specification. This paper carries out meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 208 elasticities derived from the literature to uncover the reasons for the differences in empirical results across studies. Several causes of variation are identified. There is also clear evidence of downward publication bias. In addition, many reported t-statistics are biased upwards due to the use of aggregate unemployment rates. A maximum likelihood method and a trimming procedure are used to correct for these biases. Both methods give similar results for our sample. An unbiased estimate of the wage curve elasticity at the means of study characteristics is about - 0.07.

Nonetheless, a common missing element in most migration studies is the lack of awareness of the overall network topology, which characterizes migration flows. Although gravity models focus on spatial interaction\u2014in this case migration\u2014between pairs of origins and destinations, they do not provide insights into the topology of a migration network. We employ network analysis to address such systemic research questions, in particular: how centralized or dispersed are migration flows and how does this structure evolve over time? And, how is migration activity clustered between specific countries, and if it is clustered, do such patterns change over time? Going a step further than exploratory network analysis, in this paper we estimate international migration models for OECD countries based on a dual approach: gravity models estimated using conventional econometric approaches such as panel data regressions and network-based regression techniques such as multivariate regression quadratic assignment procedures. The empirical results reveal not only the determinants of international migration among OECD countries, but also the value of blending network analysis with more conventional analytic methods.

The negative externalities of uncontrolled immigration are well known and often hard to cope with. Recent years have seen the appearance of many policy initiatives based on self-reliance principles for ethnic groups. Against this background, ethnic entrepreneurship has become a popular strategy as it stimulates and encourages migrants to look after themselves with only limited support from the government: such policies are becoming increasingly important in many large cities. In addition to the conventional educational support and training programmes, such strategies need to implement policies aimed at self-employment. An emphasis on ethnic entrepreneurship is an attempt to exploit the economic potential and opportunities of foreign migrants, instead of focusing on the problems which minorities encounter when entering the labour market. In ethnic entrepreneurship this potential can be utilised in a creative way, especially if well-organised projects and initiatives are set up. The authors compare various assistance programmes and urban policies in several European cities, which are aimed at favouring ethnic entrepreneurship, with the aim of drawing lessons for effective labour-market policies. Their approach is to employ a systematic information base concerning self-employment strategies in the cities under investigation. A newly developed comparative statistical method for categorical information, namely, rough-set analysis, is used in order to identify critical success factors. The results suggest that utilisation of social networks is most helpful in enhancing self-employment among ethnic minorities.

This implies a linear relationship between the price elasticity of total fuel demand and the price elasticities of fuel efficiency, mileage per car and car ownership. In this meta-analytical study we aim to investigate and explain the variation in empirical estimates of the price elasticity of gasoline demand. A methodological novelty is that we use the linear relationship between the elasticities to develop a meta-analytical estimation approach based on a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with Cross Equation Restrictions. This approach enables us to combine observations of different elasticities and thus increase our sample size. Furthermore, it allows for a more detailed interpretation of our meta-regression results. The empirical results of the study demonstrate that the SUR approach leads to more precise results (i.e., lower standard errors) than a standard meta-analytical approach. We find that, with mean short run and long run price elasticities of - 0.34 and - 0.84, respectively, the demand for gasoline is not very price sensitive. Both in the short and the long run, the impact of a change in the gasoline price on demand is mainly driven by responses in fuel efficiency and mileage per car and to a slightly lesser degree by changes in car ownership.

They show that despite the existence of a credit market imperfection, because, inter alia, the regional authority (RA) does not have an informational advantage over the private sector, it is not possible for this RA to use fiscal policy to make a Pareto improving intervention in which some agents are better off and others are no worse off.", "authors": ["epba34", "epni111"], "abstractStem": "the author analyz two hitherto littl studi but salient question concern the triniti of asymmetr inform entrepreneuri activ and the scope of fiscal polici in an open region economi first the author use a twoperiod model to analyz the contractu relationship between entrepreneur and ventur capitalist when the latter are locat outsid the region becaus there is moral hazard ventur capitalist do not offer entrepreneur the first best invest contract and entrepreneuri activ is suboptim second they analyz a twoperiod model with ventur capitalist who are now locat insid the region economi they show that despit the exist of a credit market imperfect becaus inter alia the region author ra doe not have an inform advantag over the privat sector it is not possibl for thi ra to use fiscal polici to make a pareto improv intervent in which some agent are better off and other are no wors off", "title": "Asymmetric Information, Entrepreneurial Activity, and the Scope of Fiscal Policy in an Open Regional Economy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/pio/envirc/v25y2007i5p633-637.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epni111", "fpva400"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Local knowledge and innovation policy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jregsc/v53y2013i5p745-748.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpko637", "epni111"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Introduction: Regional Innovation Hotspots And Spatial Development"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/rgscpp/v6y2014i4p349-360.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epni111"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "FDI penetration and manufacturing agglomeration: an analysis based on empirical evidence from 21 industries (2004\u20132010)"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/soceps/v36y2002i2p127-138.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpbu390", "epni111"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Ceteris paribus, meta-analysis and value transfer"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jgeosy/v12y2010i4p355-387.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["eplo52", "epni111", "eppo117"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Joint impacts of immigration on wages and employment: review and meta-analysis"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/pio/envirc/v9y1991i3p267-279.html": {"abstract": "In this paper, the major frictions that the twelve countries of the European Community face with regard to elderly care are enumerated and explained.

In the container terminal handling market, quality is important in attracting and retaining customers. Meeting customer needs and delivering high quality for low costs are critical factors for terminals to be successful. Container transport companies are interested in speed and reliability. The time a ship or barge stays in a port must be minimised, and, therefore, the handling of containers must be executed in a fast and reliable way. The operations at the terminal, after the handling of the containers on and off the ship, must be reliable as well. Quantitative information on container terminal quality is hard to obtain. Container terminals are monitoring their quality levels, but the results are not publicly available. Therefore, a literature survey forms the main input for this paper combined with interviews with terminal operators. The aim of this paper is to offer an operational approach for the measurement of the quality of container terminal services. The central research question is: which are critical performance conditions in terms of quality for container terminals? For the container terminal sector in Europe, reliability is now the number 1 quality aspect in their transport services (including container terminal handling). Quality levels must meet high standards set by container carriers. Costs, incurred by better quality performance cannot be recovered through higher rates. Reliability, in terms of meeting container carriers\u2019 demand, is thus a critical performance condition for maritime container terminals. An external performance improvement characteristic might be flexibility. Deep-sea ship arrivals are no easy planning task, as weather influences and other problematic developments make the terminal operator\u2019s task more difficult. Through strict contracts, all risks of delays and terminal berth congestion are passed onto the terminal operator. This makes flexibility a critical performance condition.

In relation to the latter, we address in particular (1) the effect of local cultural industries on migration (as a continuation of Florida\u2019s hypothesis) and (2) the effect of culture on social well-being (alternatively measured by means of level of happiness and level of crime in terms of property theft). Our paper is, therefore, a novel contribution, providing a better understanding of the link between arts, culture and regional development and also facilitating an innovative evaluation of cultural impact relevant in the developmental debate in an extended socio-economic sense.

Our objective is to examine the conditions under which we can observe a relocation of firms from an urban location to a new extra-urban location. Our methodological framework is based on the model of monopolistic competition, which examines the economic relationships among firms at each industrial location and the relationships among distinct firms at different locations. These intrarelationships and interrelationships are examined according to the concept of complementarity. Complementarity in our case combines the notions of (1) firm interaction with cumulative and reinforcing effects, and (2) coordination among firms in local industrial structures.

A., Baycan-Levent T., Nijkamp P. and Poot J. Roles of local and newcomer entrepreneurs in rural development: a comparative meta-analytic study, Regional Studies . Early studies of rural development suggested that newcomer rural entrepreneurs are important agents of change and responsible for new spatial development, but more recent research has concluded that there is no difference between newcomer and local rural entrepreneurs in this respect. Much of this literature is based on qualitative ethnographic case studies. Systematic pooling and scrutinizing of the main attributes and findings of such studies enhances their comparability and permits some generalization. Newcomer and local rural entrepreneurship is therefore investigated by means of a meta-analysis of twenty-two applied studies. The statistical results show that newcomer entrepreneurs are relatively older, better educated, and develop more non-agricultural business. They appear to be predominantly attracted by a rural lifestyle. In many cases, newcomer entrepreneurs are not directly the instigators of economic development, but their contribution to physical capital formation is greater than that of the locals.  Akg\u00fcn A.

In fr\u00fcheren Studien \u00fcber die Entwicklung in l\u00e4ndlichen Gebieten wurde die These aufgestellt, dass neue Unternehmer im l\u00e4ndlichen Raum wichtige Akteure f\u00fcr Ver\u00e4nderungen darstellen und f\u00fcr neue r\u00e4umliche Entwicklungen verantwortlich sind. Aus aktuelleren Studien geht jedoch hervor, dass es in dieser Hinsicht keine Unterschiede zwischen neuen und lokalen Unternehmern im l\u00e4ndlichen Raum gibt. Ein Gro\u00dfteil dieser Literatur basiert auf qualitativen ethnografischen Fallstudien. Durch eine systematische Zusammenfassung und Untersuchung der Hauptmerkmale und Ergebnisse dieser Studien verbessert sich ihre Vergleichbarkeit, und es lassen sich einige Verallgemeinerungen anstellen. Zu diesem Zweck untersuchen wir das neue und lokale Unternehmertum in l\u00e4ndlichen Gebieten mit Hilfe einer Metaanalyse von 22 angewandten Studien. Aus den statistischen Ergebnissen geht hervor, dass neue Unternehmer relativ \u00e4lter und gebildeter sind und einen h\u00f6heren Anteil von nicht landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben entwickeln. Diese Unternehmer scheinen vor allem durch eine l\u00e4ndliche Lebensweise angezogen zu werden. In vielen F\u00e4llen sind die neuen Unternehmer nicht unmittelbar f\u00fcr die Wirtschaftsentwicklung verantwortlich, doch ihr Beitrag zur Bildung von physischem Kapital f\u00e4llt h\u00f6her aus als der der lokalen Unternehmer.

E-services implemented by the tourism industry, e.g., e-tourism, appeared to produce significant cost reductions and market efficiencies. Since online services are continuously accessible, time and geographic differences do not hinder the interaction between tourism service providers and their customers anymore. By using ICTs, (small) tourism organisations can enlarge their markets or operate in niche markets by serving a specific group of customers. The increased use of ICTs has thus resulted in a significant change in the structure of the tourism industry. The present paper aims to provide an overview of experiences and findings that address the socioeconomic impacts of e-services for the (cultural) tourist industry, on the basis of a systematic impact analysis. We use a SWOT approach to organise a systematic evaluation of various e-services effects, which are specifically differentiated for e-services and e-tourism (including cultural heritage) of socioeconomic importance.

Neural networks are modern statistical tools based on learning algorithms that are able to process large amounts of data. Neural networks are enjoying increasing interest in several fields because of their effectiveness in handling complex data sets when the functional relationship between dependent and independent variables is not specified explicitly. The present paper compares two NN methodologies. First, it uses NNs to forecast regional employment in both the former West and East Germany. Each model implemented computes single estimates of employment growth rates for each German district, with a 2-year forecasting range. Next, additional forecasts are computed, by combining the NN methodology with shift-share analysis (SSA). Since SSA aims to identify variations observed among the labour districts, its results are used as further explanatory variables in the NN models. The data set used in our experiments consists of a panel of 439 German (NUTS 3) districts. Because of differences in the size and time horizons of the data, the forecasts for West and East Germany are computed separately. The out-of-sample forecasting ability of the models is evaluated by means of several appropriate statistical indicators.

Les RN sont des outils statistiques modernes fond\u00e9s sur des algorithmes d'apprentissage, capables de traiter de grandes quantit\u00e9s de donn\u00e9es. On s'int\u00e9resse de plus en plus aux RN car ils permettent de g\u00e9rer efficacement des s\u00e9ries de donn\u00e9es complexes, bien que la relation fonctionnelle entre les variables d\u00e9pendantes et ind\u00e9pendantes n'est pas d\u00e9finie explicitement.

RESUMEN Nuevos m\u00e9todos de redes neurales para la previsi\u00f3n de empleo regional: un an\u00e1lisis para los mercados laborales de Alemania En este documento desarrollamos una serie de modelos de redes neurales (RN) para calcular las previsiones a corto plazo de los modelos de empleo regional en Alemania. Las RN son modernas herramientas de estad\u00edsticas basadas en algoritmos de aprendizaje capaces de procesar un gran n\u00famero de datos. Las RN se est\u00e1n popularizando cada vez m\u00e1s en diferentes campos porque son capaces de manejar grupos de datos complejos cuando la relaci\u00f3n funcional entre las variables dependientes e independientes no est\u00e1 expl\u00edcitamente especificada. En este art\u00edculo comparamos dos metodolog\u00edas de RN. Primero, utilizamos las RN para pronosticar el empleo regional en Alemania del oeste y del este. Cada modelo aplicado computa por separado los c\u00e1lculos de las tasas de crecimiento de empleo para cada distrito alem\u00e1n, con un intervalo de previsi\u00f3n de 2 a\u00f1os. Luego se calculan las previsiones adicionales combinando la metodolog\u00eda de las RN con el an\u00e1lisis shift-share. Dado que los an\u00e1lisis shift-share identifican las variaciones observadas entre los distritos laborales, sus resultados se utilizan como otras variables explicatorios en los modelos de RN. El grupo de datos utilizado en nuestros experimentos abarca un panel de 439 distritos alemanes. Las previsiones para Alemania del oeste y este se computan por separado debido a las diferencias en los horizontes de tama\u00f1o y tiempo de los datos.

It starts with a review of two difficulties associated with urban economics models: the empirically falsified prediction of the relation between commuting time and income, and the presence of substantial excess commuting. Notwithstanding these anomalies, research that focuses directly on the value of travel time provides evidence that there is substantial resistance against commuting among large groups of workers. However, commuting costs are just one among many other explanatory variables for actual commuting behavior, and commuting itself has become much less onerous over time. This suggests that commuting costs play a much more limited role than has been assumed in the past. On the other hand, empirical evidence suggests that space is more important than one would be inclined to think on the basis of the considerations just given. These empirical regularities suggest that other space-related aspects of the functioning of urban labor and housing markets are more important than was previously thought.

A low degree of socio-economic and cultural diversity may be beneficial for neighbourhoods, whereas an excessive degree of diversity may be harmful. We test this hypothesis by (i) constructing a migrant clustering index for all neighbourhoods in the Netherlands based on a gamma index; and, subsequently, (ii) incorporating it in a regression framework to assess three relevant socio-economic outcomes: neighbourhood income, number of students, and average housing value. We show that there is apparently an optimal level of migrant clustering, and that it is remarkably robust.

In this paper firms' recruitment strategies and channels of recruitment are addressed in relation to the spatial search radius for new employees. The spatial radius is linked to the employer's attempt to convey the vacancy-related information to a targeted group of potential applicants, with a focus on the distribution of the distance between the location of the firm and the place of residence of the hired applicant. In this framework, a new statistical model is developed in order to investigate the impact of different recruitment strategies -- which differ with respect to both the spatial search radius and the type of information used -- on the probability of a match between the vacant position and an applicant located at a given distance from the firm. The model is implemented and tested by means of an extensive micro data set on the recruitment behaviour of Dutch firms. It is found that job requirements with respect to educational level and required working experience are important elements in the recruitment procedure, as they significantly affect the spatial dimension of search. Moreover, the use of interactive information through informal communication channels seems to be effective for short-distance matches, thus suggesting the relevance of local contact networks.", "authors": ["epni111", "epri130"], "abstractStem": "it is wide recogn that employ hire standard and spatial search radiu are close link to their recruit decis a strategi to identifi the right peopl in the right place may save firm a substanti amount of effort and financi resourc unfortun econom theori ha often neglect thi item when deal with spatial search and recruit issu in thi paper firm recruit strategi and channel of recruit are address in relat to the spatial search radiu for new employe the spatial radiu is link to the employ attempt to convey the vacancyrel inform to a target group of potenti applic with a focu on the distribut of the distanc between the locat of the firm and the place of resid of the hire applic in thi framework a new statist model is develop in order to investig the impact of differ recruit strategi  which differ with respect to both the spatial search radiu and the type of inform use  on the probabl of a match between the vacant posit and an applic locat at a given distanc from the firm the model is implement and test by mean of an extens micro data set on the recruit behaviour of dutch firm it is found that job requir with respect to educ level and requir work experi are import element in the recruit procedur as they significantli affect the spatial dimens of search moreov the use of interact inform through inform commun channel seem to be effect for shortdist match thu suggest the relev of local contact network", "title": "Spatial aspects of recruitment behaviour of firms: an empirical investigation"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/empeco/v13y1988i1p35-57.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epni111"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Innovative Behaviour, Agglomeration Economies and R&amp;D; Infrastructure"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ren/journl/v4y2012i2p179-208.html": {"abstract": "This paper aims to introduce Migration Impact Assessment (MIA) as a new methodological tool to estimate the socio-economic impacts of migrants on local, regional or national economies.

Several researchers have shown an interest in analysing the dynamic adjustment processes of unemployment and the average degree of dependence of the current unemployment rates or gross domestic product from the ones observed in the past. In this paper, we present a new econometric approach to the study of regional unemployment persistence, in order to account for spatial heterogeneity and/or spatial autocorrelation in both the levels and the dynamics of unemployment. First, we propose an econometric procedure suggesting the use of spatial filtering techniques as a substitute for fixed effects in a panel estimation framework. The spatial filter computed here is a proxy for spatially distributed region-specific information (e.g., the endowment of natural resources, or the size of the 'home market') that is usually incorporated in the fixed effects parameters. The same argument applies for the spatial filter modelling of the heterogenous dynamics. The advantages of our proposed procedure are that the spatial filter, by incorporating region-specific information that generates spatial autocorrelation, frees up degrees of freedom, simultaneously corrects for time-stable spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, and provides insights about the spatial patterns in regional adjustment processes. We present several experiments in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the heterogeneous autoregressive parameters estimated for unemployment data for German NUTS-3 regions.

The only fundamental change in proximity needs among these young, innovative companies originates from a small class of \u2018network companies\u2019, which are footloose even beyond the larger metropolitan area.

However, an important element that is missing in both the neoclassical and endogenous growth approaches is a multiregional perspective. The present theoretical study tries to present one of the first attempts to fill this gap. The analysis is based on a model of two interactive regions, with possible interaction between the regional environments via the global environment. The implications of this type of analysis are manifold. One is that endogeneity of growth is not only due to technology and knowledge formation but also to the effects of trade, resource scarcity and environmental degradation.

Main problems may occur in urban transport, where not many promising solutions are expected, while the problems are severe. In view of the great number of uncertainties, we will in our paper resort to the use of scenarios. We will address in particular expert scenarios, concerned with a sustainable transport system, by applying the recently developed spider model. Based on a set of distinct characteristics, represented in eight axes in the spatial, institutional, economic and social-psychological field, an evaluation framework is constructed which visualises the driving forces that largely influence the future of the urban transport system. Next, expected and desired scenarios are constructed on the basis of information obtained from a survey among Dutch transport experts (both average scenarios and scenarios reflecting segments of respondents). The expected scenarios show that many current trends will continue, while the transport system is largely the same as the current one. The desired scenarios on the other hand, suggest the emergence and the need for a more collective system, in which also many new modes are operating. In the paper the resulting urban transport systems are also discussed. By calculating the CO2 emissions in the average expected and desired scenario, we can test the fulfilment of environmental quality norms. It appears that the expected scenario does not lead to a significant reduction of those emissions; the desired scenario however, may lead to a large scale reduction of the emissions.

General characteristics of models to be used for sustainable development are discussed. It turns out that such models do not exist. Short critical descriptions are given of representative analytical models that have arisen in theories on economic growth with renewable and nonrenewable resources, and pollution, or that provide an interesting alternative view of economic - environmental interactions. These models appear to provide incomplete descriptions of economic, ecological, and interactive processes. To clarify the logic and special features of the general model, three issues are addressed. First, a general ecological model is proposed that is consistent with macroeconomic system in terms of geographical coverage. Such a general model would have to be able to deal with a specific set of general functions and characteristics of ecological systems. Second, the meaning of some economic, ecological, and physical concepts for modelling is discussed. Third, the potential for inclusion of sustainable development conditions is examined. Next, the general structure of an economic - ecological model for sustainable development is presented. It includes the general ecological model, descriptions of economic activities and dynamics, material and economic balances, constraints, and behavioural feedback mechanisms related to sustainable development conditions. It is shown how concern for the well-being of future generations can be included. Simulation is used to obtain insight into the behaviour of the system under different policies and scenarios. Several environmental policies can be studied, including waste treatment, recycling, research and development, and environmental cleaning. Resource use strategies may include sustainable use and specific division of extraction between renewable and nonrenewable resources.

The present study will address both the driving forces of this 'new entrepreneurship' and the socio-economic implications for modern cities.

This paper addresses the key factors determining the economic position of migrant entrepreneurs in the urban economy in the Netherlands, with an application to Amsterdam. So far, little information on success conditions for migrant entrepreneurship is available, while quantitative knowledge on critical success factors (CSFs) is lagging far behind the rapid growth of migrant entrepreneurs in big cities like Amsterdam. The present study serves to fill this knowledge gap, by paying attention to the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants, the role of their social networks, and the innovative potential of new growth markets in a modern city. In order to provide a solid assessment of CSFs for migrant entrepreneurs, and to understand business performance in a competitive urban environment, this study will investigate the entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants in Dutch cities from a micro-economic perspective. Due insight into individual entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants is needed to develop an urban business culture in which migrants are no longer a source of problems but of great socio-economic opportunities, both for the migrant groups concerned and the vitality of cities. Our research employs a comparative statistical analysis of empirical findings in the city of Amsterdam in order to map out opportunities, success conditions and bottlenecks for migrant entrepreneurs. Given our largely categorical (i.e. qualitative or soft) database, we will employ a qualitative causal pattern recognition technique, namely, rough set analysis, to systematically assess the conditions for successful entrepreneurship of migrants.

The main emphasis in SOC is on the analysis of the impact of slow exogenous forces in combination with strong localised interactions between single elements or components of the systems concerned, with particular regard to the attainment of a critical state at the macro-level. Against this background, SOC serves to identify the critical conditions from the internal dynamics of the systems that lead to major and significant transformations of their behaviour. The present paper aims to offer insights and reflections originating from the SOC concept, as well as to explore its potential contribution to understanding the evolution of regional economic patterns, in particular the functioning of regional labour markets. In our study, the evolutionary dynamics of employment at a district level in West Germany as well as in the combined West and East German setting will be investigated, in order to detect the possible existence of a power law distribution of growth rates, which may be seen as an indication for SOC at the macro-economic level.
