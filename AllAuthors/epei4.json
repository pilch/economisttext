First, our confidence in the evidence is fundamentally affected once we abandon the fiction that we actually know the true values of the structural parameters of standard Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. What the data are telling us is that, while productivity shocks play some role in generating the business cycle, there is simply an enormous amount of uncertainty about just what percent of aggregate fluctuations they actually do account for.

When consumers' preferences are assumed to be quadratic, there is very little evidence against the hypothesis that the services from durable goods and nondurable goods are perfect substitutes. These results call into question the practice of testing quadratic models of aggregate consumption using data on nondurables and services only. When we consider S branch specifications, we find more evidence against perfect substitutability between service flows, but less evidence against strict separability across durable and nondurable consumption goods.

The framework incorporates a banking sector and distinguishes between M1, the monetary base, currency and various measures of reserves: total, excess and non borrowed. We use a variant of the model to analyze two sets of empirical facts. The first set of facts is that different monetary aggregates covary differently with short term nominal interest rates. Broad monetary aggregates like M1 and the monetary base covary positively with current and future values of short term interest rates. In contrast, the non borrowed reserves of banks covary negatively with current and future interest rates. Observations like this `sign switch' lie at the core of recent debates about the effects of monetary policy actions on short term interest rates. According to our model, the sign switch occurs because movements in non borrowed reserves are dominated by exogenous shocks to monetary policy, while movements in the base and M1 are dominated by endogenous responses to non-policy shocks. The second set of facts that we consider is that broad monetary aggregates covary positively with output. We quantify the Friedman and Schwartz hypothesis that this covariation reflects the effects of exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and the hypothesis that they reflect the endogenous response of monetary aggregates to shocks in the private economy.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epch40", "epch45", "epei4"], "abstractStem": "thi paper present a quantit gener equilibrium model with multipl monetari aggreg the framework incorpor a bank sector and distinguish between m1 the monetari base currenc and variou measur of reserv total excess and non borrow we use a variant of the model to analyz two set of empir fact the first set of fact is that differ monetari aggreg covari differ with short term nomin interest rate broad monetari aggreg like m1 and the monetari base covari posit with current and futur valu of short term interest rate in contrast the non borrow reserv of bank covari neg with current and futur interest rate observ like thi sign switch lie at the core of recent debat about the effect of monetari polici action on short term interest rate accord to our model the sign switch occur becaus movement in non borrow reserv are domin by exogen shock to monetari polici while movement in the base and m1 are domin by endogen respons to nonpolici shock the second set of fact that we consid is that broad monetari aggreg covari posit with output we quantifi the friedman and schwartz hypothesi that thi covari reflect the effect of exogen shock to monetari polici and the hypothesi that they reflect the endogen respons of monetari aggreg to shock in the privat economypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Inside money, outside money and short-term interest rates"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v45y2001i7p1151-1193.html": {"abstract": "Currency crises that coincide with banking crises tend to share four elements. First, governments provide guarantees to domestic and foreign bank creditors. Second, banks do not hedge their exchange rate risk. Third, there is a lending boom before the crises. Finally, when the currency/banking collapse occurs, interest rates rise and there is a persistent decline in output. This paper proposes an explanation for these regularities. We show that government guarantees lower interest rates and generate an economic boom. They also lead to a more fragile banking system; banks choose not to hedge exchange rate risk. When the fixed exchange rate is abandoned in favor of a crawling peg, banks go bankrupt, the domestic interest rate rises, real wages fall, and output declines.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epbu20", "epei4", "epre4"], "abstractStem": "currenc crise that coincid with bank crise tend to share four element first govern provid guarante to domest and foreign bank creditor second bank do not hedg their exchang rate risk third there is a lend boom befor the crise final when the currencybank collaps occur interest rate rise and there is a persist declin in output thi paper propos an explan for these regular we show that govern guarante lower interest rate and gener an econom boom they also lead to a more fragil bank system bank choos not to hedg exchang rate risk when the fix exchang rate is abandon in favor of a crawl peg bank go bankrupt the domest interest rate rise real wage fall and output declinespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Hedging and financial fragility in fixed exchange rate regimes"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedhep/y1998iqiiip29-43nv.22no.3.html": {"abstract": "This article studies the impact on aggregate economic activity of increases in defense purchases which are unrelated to other developments in the economy.

It does so by creating the potential for private expectations about the response of monetary policy to exogenous shocks to be self-fulfilling. Among the many equilibria that are possible, some have good welfare properties. But others exhibit welfare-decreasing volatility in output and employment. We refer to the latter type of equilibria as expectation traps. In effect, our paper presents a new argument for commitment in monetary policy because commitment eliminates these bad equilibria.

However once we allow for shocks to technology and the costs of producing output firms will also use inventories to shift production from periods in which production costs are relatively high to periods in which production costs are relatively low. In this sense inventories can serve to smooth production costs rather production levels. In this paper we examine the empirical plausibility of the production level and production cost smoothing models of inventories. Our basic strategy is to derive and contrast a set of unconditional moment restrictions Implied by these models in a way that minimizes the role of auxiliary assumptions regarding market structure and Industry demand. We find overwhelming evidence against the production level smoothing model and very little evidence against the production cost smoothing mode1 We conclude that the variance of production exceeds the variance of sales in most manufacturing industries because the production cost smoothing role of inventories is quantitatively more important than the production level smoothing role of inventories.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epei4"], "abstractStem": "the product smooth model of inventori ha long been the basic paradigm within which empir research on inventori ha been conduct the basic hypothesi embed in thi model is that inventori of finish good serv primarili to smooth product level in the face of fluctuat demand and convex cost function howev onc we allow for shock to technolog and the cost of produc output firm will also use inventori to shift product from period in which product cost are rel high to period in which product cost are rel low in thi sens inventori can serv to smooth product cost rather product level in thi paper we examin the empir plausibl of the product level and product cost smooth model of inventori our basic strategi is to deriv and contrast a set of uncondit moment restrict impli by these model in a way that minim the role of auxiliari assumpt regard market structur and industri demand we find overwhelm evid against the product level smooth model and veri littl evid against the product cost smooth mode1 we conclud that the varianc of product exce the varianc of sale in most manufactur industri becaus the product cost smooth role of inventori is quantit more import than the product level smooth role of inventoriespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Some Empirical Evidence on the Production Level and Production Cost Smoothing Models of Inventory Investment"}}}
