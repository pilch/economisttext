It begins with a critical assessment of the existing literature, arguing that most work is based on implausible models of inflation-output dynamics. It then suggests that this problem may be solved with some recent behavioral models, which assume that price setters are slow to incorporate macroeconomic information into the prices they set. A specific such model is developed and used to derive optimal policy. In response to shocks to productivity and aggregate demand, optimal policy is price level targeting. Base drift in the price level, which is implicit in the inflation targeting regimes currently used in many central banks, is not desirable in this model. When shocks to desired markups are added, optimal policy is flexible targeting of the price level. That is, the central bank should allow the price level to deviate from its target for a while in response to these supply shocks, but it should eventually return the price level to its target path. Optimal policy can also be described as an elastic price standard: the central bank allows the price level to deviate from its target when output is expected to deviate from its natural rate.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpba605", "epma131", "epre73"], "abstractStem": "thi paper is a contribut to the analysi of optim monetari polici it begin with a critic assess of the exist literatur argu that most work is base on implaus model of inflationoutput dynam it then suggest that thi problem may be solv with some recent behavior model which assum that price setter are slow to incorpor macroeconom inform into the price they set a specif such model is develop and use to deriv optim polici in respons to shock to product and aggreg demand optim polici is price level target base drift in the price level which is implicit in the inflat target regim current use in mani central bank is not desir in thi model when shock to desir markup are ad optim polici is flexibl target of the price level that is the central bank should allow the price level to deviat from it target for a while in respons to these suppli shock but it should eventu return the price level to it target path optim polici can also be describ as an elast price standard the central bank allow the price level to deviat from it target when output is expect to deviat from it natur ratepthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Monetary policy for inattentive economies"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/jeurec/v1y2003i5p1058-1086.html": {"abstract": " This paper assumes that a central bank commits itself to maintaining an inflation target and then asks what measure of the inflation rate the central bank should use if it wants to maximize economic stability. The paper first formalizes this problem and examines its microeconomic foundations. It then shows how the weight of a sector in the stability price index depends on the sector's characteristics, including size, cyclical sensitivity, sluggishness of price adjustment, and magnitude of sectoral shocks. When a numerical illustration of the problem is calibrated to U.S. data, one tentative conclusion is that a central bank that wants to achieve maximum stability of economic activity should use a price index that gives substantial weight to the level of nominal wages.
