It shows that inference about the key money demand elasticity parameter, a, is very senstitive to the specification of the dynamic interaction of the unobserved money demand shock with prices and money. In particular, if T. J. Sargent's 1977 specification is modified, then his basic conclusions are overturned: identification of a does not require prior knowledge about the covariance of unobserved shock terms; and d ata on the German hyperinflation imply a sharp, not loose estimate of a, which is of plausible magnitude.

The reason may be the absence of commitment in monetary policy. In a standard model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps, even without trigger strategies. In these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions, which then make accommodating those expectations the optimal monetary policy. Under commitment, the equilibrium is unique and the inflation rate is low on average. This analysis suggests that institutions which promote commitment can prevent high inflation episodes from recurring.

The framework incorporates a banking sector and distinguishes between M1, the monetary base, currency and various measures of reserves: total, excess and non borrowed. We use a variant of the model to analyze two sets of empirical facts. The first set of facts is that different monetary aggregates covary differently with short term nominal interest rates. Broad monetary aggregates like M1 and the monetary base covary positively with current and future values of short term interest rates. In contrast, the non borrowed reserves of banks covary negatively with current and future interest rates. Observations like this `sign switch' lie at the core of recent debates about the effects of monetary policy actions on short term interest rates. According to our model, the sign switch occurs because movements in non borrowed reserves are dominated by exogenous shocks to monetary policy, while movements in the base and M1 are dominated by endogenous responses to non-policy shocks. The second set of facts that we consider is that broad monetary aggregates covary positively with output. We quantify the Friedman and Schwartz hypothesis that this covariation reflects the effects of exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and the hypothesis that they reflect the endogenous response of monetary aggregates to shocks in the private economy.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epch40", "epch45", "epei4"], "abstractStem": "thi paper present a quantit gener equilibrium model with multipl monetari aggreg the framework incorpor a bank sector and distinguish between m1 the monetari base currenc and variou measur of reserv total excess and non borrow we use a variant of the model to analyz two set of empir fact the first set of fact is that differ monetari aggreg covari differ with short term nomin interest rate broad monetari aggreg like m1 and the monetari base covari posit with current and futur valu of short term interest rate in contrast the non borrow reserv of bank covari neg with current and futur interest rate observ like thi sign switch lie at the core of recent debat about the effect of monetari polici action on short term interest rate accord to our model the sign switch occur becaus movement in non borrow reserv are domin by exogen shock to monetari polici while movement in the base and m1 are domin by endogen respons to nonpolici shock the second set of fact that we consid is that broad monetari aggreg covari posit with output we quantifi the friedman and schwartz hypothesi that thi covari reflect the effect of exogen shock to monetari polici and the hypothesi that they reflect the endogen respons of monetari aggreg to shock in the privat economypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Inside money, outside money and short-term interest rates"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedmqr/y1987ifallp2-20nv.11no.4.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epch45"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Why is consumption less volatile than income?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/compec/v20y2002i1-2p21-55.html": {"abstract": " I present an undetermined coefficients method for obtaining a linear approximating to the solution of a class of dynamic, rational expectations models.
