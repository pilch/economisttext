This model of investment finance is then embedded in a dynamic macroeconomic setting. We show that, first, since reductions in collateral in bad times increase the agency costs of borrowing, which in turn depress the demand for investment, the presence of these financial factors will tend to amplify swings in real output.

A careful reading of the evidence does not support it. True, on-balance sheet assets held by commercial banks have declined as a share of total intermediary assets. But this measure ignores the substantial growth in banks' off-balance sheet activities, in off-shore lending by foreign banks, and in the size of the financial intermediation sector. Adjusted for these considerations, the bank-assets measure shows no clear evidence of secular decline. Neither does an alternative measure, constructed using data from the national income accounts. At most, banking may have suffered a slight loss of market share lately.

We consider a local approximation around a zero inflation steady state and introduce infrequent idiosyncratic shocks. The resulting Phillips curve is a simple variant of the conventional time-dependent Calvo formulation with important differences. First, the model is able to match the micro evidence on the magnitude and timing of price adjustments. Second, our state-dependent model exhibits greater flexibility in the aggregate price level than the time-dependent model. With real rigidities present, however, our model can exhibit nominal stickiness similar to a conventional time-dependent model. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago.

We then use the model to evaluate the effects of the central bank using unconventional monetary policy to combat a simulated financial crisis. We interpret unconventional monetary policy as expanding central bank credit intermediation to offset a disruption of private financial intermediation. Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced.", "authors": ["epge11", "fpka365"], "abstractStem": "we develop a quantit monetari dsge model with financi intermediari that face endogen determin balanc sheet constraint we then use the model to evalu the effect of the central bank use unconvent monetari polici to combat a simul financi crisi we interpret unconvent monetari polici as expand central bank credit intermedi to offset a disrupt of privat financi intermedi within our framework the central bank is less effici than privat intermediari at make loan but it ha the advantag of be abl to elast obtain fund by issu riskless govern debt unlik privat intermediari it is not balanc sheet constrain dure a crisi the balanc sheet constraint on privat intermediari tighten rais the net benefit from central bank intermedi these benefit may be substanti even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nomin interest rate is not bind in the event thi constraint is bind though these net benefit may be significantli enhanc", "title": "A model of unconventional monetary policy"}}}
