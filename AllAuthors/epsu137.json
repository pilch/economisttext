The question has remained controversial because, as with other macroeconomic questions, experiments to check divergent hypotheses cannot be deliberately performed, so economists must rely upon the often dubious evidence from the limited experiments with which nature and history have endowed us. This paper discusses the results of an exceptionally good natural experiment that has been provided by Canada and the U.S. over the past thirty-five years. After moving in tandem for almost 25 years, American and Canadian private saving rates have diverged dramatically over the last decade. The primary conclusion emerging from our analysis of this phenomenon is that tax policies can have a potent impact on private savings behavior. Differences in tax structures and in the interactions of taxation and inflation appear to be important factors explaining the divergent behavior of the American and Canadian private savings rates. Recognizing the importance of asset revaluations, caused partially but not entirely by tax effects, also helps to explain the different behavior of U.S. and Canadian savings.

Second, what does the crash of the Nasdaq tell us about the future of the new economy? Third, how should government regulation of the economy change so as to maximize the benefits we reap from these ongoing technological revolutions? And fourth, how will the American economy respond to the shock to public confidence and the destruction caused by the terror attacks of September 11?&gt; In exploring answers to these questions, the authors found the following: The long-run economic impact of the ongoing technological revolutions in data processing and data communications will be very large indeed. The crash of the Nasdaq tells us next to nothing about the dimensions of the economic transformation that we are undergoing. It does, however, tell us that the new economy is more likely to be a source of downward pressure on margins than of large durable quasi-rents. The principal effects of the \"new economy\" are more likely to be \"microeconomic\" than \"macroeconomic,\" and they will lead to profound\u2014if at present unclear\u2014changes in how the government should act to provide the property rights, institutional frameworks, and \"rules of the game\" that underpin the market economy. And finally, the events of September 11 will slow private investment in new technologies, but U.S. military spending is likely to increase, and the increase in military spending will be concentrated on high-technology data-processing and data-communications products.

This view implies that while the total effective tax rate on corporate source income affects real economic decisions, the distribution of this tax burden between the shareholders and the corporation is irrelevant. Recent research has suggested an alter- native to this traditional view. One explanation of why firms in the U.S. pay dividends in spite of the heavy tax liabilities associated with this form of distribution is that the stock market capitalizes the tax payments associated with corporate distributions. This capitalization leaves investors indifferent at the margin between corporations paying our dividends and retaining earnings. This alternative view holds that while changes in the dividend tax rate will affect shareholder wealth, they will have no impact on corporate investment decisions. This paper develops econometric tests which distinguish between these two views of dividend taxation. By extending Tobin's \"q\" theory of investment to incorporate taxes at both the corporate and personal levels, the implications of each view for corporate investment decisions can be derived. The competing views may be tested by comparing the performance of investment equations estimates under each theory's predict ions. British time series data are particularly appropriate for testing hypotheses about dividend taxes because of the substantial postwar variation in effective tax rates on corporate distributions.

We make three points. First, the single most robust empirical finding about economic growth is low persistence of growth rates. Extrapolation of current growth rates into the future is at odds with all empirical evidence about the strength of regression to the mean in growth rates. Second, especially outside of the OECD countries, the process of economic growth is not at all well characterized by business cycle variations around a (relatively) stable mean. Developing country growth rates are strongly episodic and large (and apparently discrete) shifts in medium-term growth rates of 4 ppa or more common\u2014and particularly prominent are large slowdowns. Episodes of super-rapid growth tend to be of short duration and end in decelerations back to the world average growth rate. Both China and India are already in the midst of episodes that are historically long and fast. Third, while we are not predicting sharp decelerations in either economy, there are plausible scenarios based on identifiable fissures in existing growth processes that could lead to sharp and sustained periods of slow growth. We are not arguing that one can predict with any degree of accuracy or confidence a slowdown but certainly policy makers need to be prepared for a wider range of extended slow-growth outcomes in these Asian giants that those that currently dominate the discourse.

The first part treats methodological issues involved in testing for transitory return components. It demonstrates that variance ratios are among the most powerful tests for detecting mean reversion in stock prices, but that they have little power against the principal interesting alternatives to the random walk hypothesis. The second part applies variance ratio tests to market returns for the United States over the 1871-1986 period and for seventeen other countries over the 1957-1985 period, as well as to returns on individual firms over the 1926- 1985 period. We find consistent evidence that stock returns are positively serially correlated over short horizons, and negatively autocorrelated over long horizons. The point estimates suggest that the transitory components in stock prices have a standard deviation of between 15 and 25 percent and account for more than half of the variance in monthly returns. The last part of the paper discusses two possible explanations for mean reversion: time varying required returns, and slowly-decaying \"price fads\" that cause stock prices to deviate from fundamental values for periods of several years. We conclude that explaining observed transitory components in stock prices on the basis of movements in required returns due to risk factors is likely to be difficult.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["eppo19", "epsu137"], "abstractStem": "thi paper analyz the statist evid bear on whether transitori compon account for a larg fraction of the varianc in common stock return the first part treat methodolog issu involv in test for transitori return compon it demonstr that varianc ratio are among the most power test for detect mean revers in stock price but that they have littl power against the princip interest altern to the random walk hypothesi the second part appli varianc ratio test to market return for the unit state over the 18711986 period and for seventeen other countri over the 19571985 period as well as to return on individu firm over the 1926 1985 period we find consist evid that stock return are posit serial correl over short horizon and neg autocorrel over long horizon the point estim suggest that the transitori compon in stock price have a standard deviat of between 15 and 25 percent and account for more than half of the varianc in monthli return the last part of the paper discuss two possibl explan for mean revers time vari requir return and slowlydecay price fad that caus stock price to deviat from fundament valu for period of sever year we conclud that explain observ transitori compon in stock price on the basi of movement in requir return due to risk factor is like to be difficultpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Mean reversion in stock prices : Evidence and Implications"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v76y1986i5p1031-44.html": {"abstract": " This paper uses John Taylor's model of overlapping contracts to show that increased wage and price flexibility can easily be destabilizing because of the Mundell effect.
