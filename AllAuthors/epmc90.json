The use of time-varying weights using Bayesian methods, allows dynamic combinations of the different models to obtain a more accurate VaR forecasts than the estimates and forecasts that might be produced by a single model of risk. One of these dynamic combinations is endogenously determined by the pass performance in terms of daily capital charges of the individual models. This can improve the strategies to minimize daily capital charges, which is a central objective of ADIs.

A technique is developed to estimate the DC MSV model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, and simulated data show that the estimation method works well. Various multivariate conditional volatility and MSV models are compared via simulation, including an evaluation of alternative VaR estimators. The DC MSV model is also estimated using three sets of empirical data, namely Nikkei 225 Index, Hang Seng Index and Straits Times Index returns, and significant dynamic correlations are found. The Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model is also estimated, and is found to be far less sensitive to the covariation in the shocks to the indexes.

Given the scarcity of resources, it is important for economic growth to depend on production efficiency improvement to achieve sustainability. As China is the world's second largest foreign capital recipient, foreign capital plays an important role in investment. If economic growth is fuelled by investment, an exodus or a shortage of foreign capital will render growth unsustainable. However, if growth is propelled by improvements in production efficiency, it is more likely to be sustained and to withstand reduction in production input. This paper estimates production efficiency in the agricultural sector in China with a panel data set comprising 30 provinces for the 7-year period, 1991\u20131997. A panel data model based on the Cobb\u2013Douglas production function is used to represent the production frontier and to compute technical efficiency at the provincial level. Individual effects are tested to determine if pooled estimation is preferred to unpooled (panel) estimation. The test confirms significant differences between the provinces, and hence warrants panel data estimation. Both fixed and random effects models are estimated, with provincial technical inefficiency specified as province-specific intercept terms for the former, and regression disturbances for the latter. Although the random effects model is rejected in favour of the fixed effects model, the latter did not produce estimates with correct signs, and is rejected on economic grounds.

(2002), and the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002). The dynamic correlations are extremely useful in determining whether the spot and forward returns are substitutes or complements, which can be used to hedge against contingencies. Both the univariate ARCH and GARCH estimates are significant for spot and forward returns, whereas the estimates of the asymmetric effect at the univariate level are not statistically significant for either spot or forward returns. Standard diagnostic tests show that the AR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and AR(1)-GJR(1, 1) specifications are statistically adequate for both the conditional mean and the conditional variance. The multivariate estimates for the VAR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) models show that the ARCH and GARCH effects for spot (forward) returns are significant in the conditional volatility model for spot (forward) returns. Moreover, there are significant interdependences in the conditional volatilities between the spot and forward markets. The multivariate asymmetric effects are significant for both spot and forward returns. Overall the multivariate VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) dominates its symmetric counterpart. The calculated constant conditional correlations between the conditional volatilities of spot and forward returns using CCC-GARCH(1, 1), VAR(1)-GARCH(1, 1) and VAR(1)-AGARCH(1, 1) are very close to 0.93. Virtually identical results are obtained when the three constant conditional correlation models are extended to include two lags in both the ARCH and GARCH components. Finally, the estimates of the two DCC parameters are statistically significant, which makes it clear that the assumption of constant conditional correlation is not supported empirically. This is highlighted by the dynamic conditional correlations between spot and forward returns, for which its sample mean is virtually identical to the computed constant conditional correlation, regardless of whether a DCC-GARCH(1, 1) or a DCC-GARCH(2, 2) is used. For these models, the dynamic conditional correlations are in the range (0.417, 0.993) and (0.446, 0.993), signifying medium to extreme interdependence. Therefore, the dynamic volatilities in the returns in Tapis oil spot and forward markets are generally interdependent over time.

The volatility of an asset of composite index can be traded by using volatility derivatives, such as volatility and variance swaps, options and futures. The most popular volatility index is VIX, which is a key measure of market expectations of volatility, and hence also an important barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility. Investors interpret the VIX cash index as a \u201cfear\u201d index, and of VIX options and VIX futures as derivatives of the \u201cfear\u201d index. VIX is based on S&amp;P500; call and put options over a wide range of strike prices, and hence is not model based. Speculators can trade on volatility risk with VIX derivatives, with views on whether volatility will increase or decrease in the future, while hedgers can use volatility derivatives to avoid exposure to volatility risk. VIX and its options and futures derivatives has been widely analysed in recent years. An alternative volatility derivative to VIX is the S&amp;P500; variance futures, which is an expectation of the variance of the S&amp;P500; cash index. Variance futures are futures contracts written on realized variance, or standardized variance swaps. The S&amp;P500; variance futures are not model based, so the assumptions underlying the index do not seem to have been clearly understood. As variance futures are typically thinly traded, their returns and volatility are not easy to model accurately using a variety of volatility model specifications. This paper analyses the volatility in S&amp;P500; 3-month and 12-month variance futures Before, During and After the GFC, as well as for the full data period, for each of three alternative conditional volatility models and three densities, in order to determine whether exposure to risk can be incorporated into a financial portfolio without taking positions on the S&amp;P500; index itself.", "authors": ["fpch286", "epji27", "epmc90"], "abstractStem": "model monitor and forecast volatil are indispens to sensibl portfolio risk manag the volatil of an asset of composit index can be trade by use volatil deriv such as volatil and varianc swap option and futur the most popular volatil index is vix which is a key measur of market expect of volatil and henc also an import baromet of investor sentiment and market volatil investor interpret the vix cash index as a  fear  index and of vix option and vix futur as deriv of the  fear  index vix is base on sampp500 call and put option over a wide rang of strike price and henc is not model base specul can trade on volatil risk with vix deriv with view on whether volatil will increas or decreas in the futur while hedger can use volatil deriv to avoid exposur to volatil risk vix and it option and futur deriv ha been wide analys in recent year an altern volatil deriv to vix is the sampp500 varianc futur which is an expect of the varianc of the sampp500 cash index varianc futur are futur contract written on realiz varianc or standard varianc swap the sampp500 varianc futur are not model base so the assumpt underli the index do not seem to have been clearli understood as varianc futur are typic thinli trade their return and volatil are not easi to model accur use a varieti of volatil model specif thi paper analys the volatil in sampp500 3month and 12month varianc futur befor dure and after the gfc as well as for the full data period for each of three altern condit volatil model and three densiti in order to determin whether exposur to risk can be incorpor into a financi portfolio without take posit on the sampp500 index itself", "title": "The rise and fall of S&amp;P500; variance futures"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/matcom/v39y1995i1p1-7.html": {"abstract": "The paper examines how empirical models can be constructed to describe the dependence of the error in fitting data to parametric models of probability distributions on the type of distribution, sample size, parent parameter values and percentiles of interest.

The RAMs include the classic 2-year impact factor including journal self citations (2YIF), 2-year impact factor excluding journal self citations (2YIF*), 5-year impact factor including journal self citations (5YIF), Immediacy including journal self citations, Eigenfactor (or Journal Influence), Article Influence (AI), h-index, Papers Ignored-By Even The Authors (PI-BETA), Self-citation Threshold Approval Rating (STAR), 5YD2 (namely, 5YIF divided by 2YIF), Escalating Self Citations (ESC) and Index of Citation Quality (ICQ). The paper calculates the harmonic mean (HM) of the ranks of up to 16 RAMs. It is shown that emphasizing 2YIF to the exclusion of other informative RAMs can lead to a misleading evaluation of journal quality and impact relative to the HM of the ranks. The analysis of the 89 ISI journals in Finance makes it clear that there are three leading journals in Finance, namely Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies, which form an exclusive club in terms of the RAMs that measure journal quality and impact based on alternative measures of journal citations. The next two journals in Finance in terms of overall quality and impact are Journal of Accounting and Economics and Journal of Monetary Economics.

Financial econometrics has become a mature discipline over the last two decades, and one of its major research objects is the modelling and forecasting of volatility.

The papers examine issues such as the new frontiers of volatility, the selection of models for observed and unobserved volatility, the potential long-memory property of volatility, and the measurement of volatility.

This has led to the development of two standard theories of forward and futures pricing, namely, the Cost-of-Carry and the Risk Premium (or Unbiased Expectations) hypotheses. These studies have modelled the relationship between spot and forward/futures prices either through a no-arbitrage condition or a general equilibrium setting. Relatively few studies in this area have considered the impact of stochastic trends in the data.

Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to answer the perennial questions as to When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited.

This generated a substantial amount of predominantly theoretical research into the behaviour of speculators, for which the results seem to depend critically upon the assumptions. Such theoretical models need to be tested against empirical evidence to determine whether speculators behave in a destabilising manner. Using recent theoretical developments in the literature on modelling financial volatility, this paper tests the significance of speculators and their contributions to describing weekly volatilities across a series of currency, metals and commodity markets. As the time-varying conditional volatility GARCH model and its variants have been criticised for lacking economic content, incorporating speculators into such models contributes to an accommodation of this criticism. The economic implications from establishing the importance of speculators are far-reaching. Policymakers often discuss the imposition of a Tobin tax to curb speculation, so it must be established that speculators behave in economically destructive ways.

The formal evaluation of such forecasts has a long research history. Recently, a new angle to the evaluation of forecasts has been addressed, and in this review we analyze some recent developments from that perspective. The literature on forecast evaluation predominantly assumes that macroeconomic forecasts are generated from econometric models. In practice, however, most macroeconomic forecasts, such as those from the IMF, World Bank, OECD, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and the ECB, are typically based on econometric model forecasts jointly with human intuition. This seemingly inevitable combination renders most of these forecasts biased and, as such, their evaluation becomes nonstandard. In this review, we consider the evaluation of two forecasts in which: (i) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct econometric models; (ii) one forecast is generated from an econometric model and the other is obtained as a combination of a model and intuition; and (iii) the two forecasts are generated from two distinct (but unknown) combinations of different models and intuition. It is shown that alternative tools are needed to compare and evaluate the forecasts in each of these three situations. These alternative techniques are illustrated by comparing the forecasts from the (econometric) Staff of the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC on inflation, unemployment, and real GDP growth. It is shown that the FOMC does not forecast significantly better than the Staff, and that the intuition of the FOMC does not add significantly in forecasting the actual values of the economic fundamentals.

However, the existing MSV with leverage models are unclear about the definition of leverage, specifically the timing of the relationship between the innovations in financial returns and the associated shocks to volatility, as well as their connection to partial correlations. This paper proposes a new MSV with leverage (MSVL) model in which leverage is defined clearly in terms of the innovations in both financial returns and volatility, such that the leverage effect associated with one financial return is not related to the leverage effect of another. News impact surfaces are developed for MSV models with leverage based on both log-volatility and volatility and are compared with the special case of news impact functions for their univariate counterparts. In order to capture heavy tails in each return distribution, we incorporate an additional factor for the volatility of each return. An empirical example based on bivariate data for Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Index and the Nikkei 225 Index is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the new MSVL model and the associated news impact surfaces. Likelihood ratio (LR) tests are considered for model selection. The LR tests show that the two-factor MSVL model is supported, indicating that the restrictions considered in the paper are empirically adequate under heavy-tailed return distributions.

Alternative RAMs may be calculated annually or updated daily to determine When, Where and How (frequently) published papers are cited (see Chang et al. (2011a, b, c), Chang et al. (2012)).

Given the abundant research activity in analysing time-varying volatility through Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) processes (see Engle, 1982; Bollerslev, 1986), it is important to analyse regime switching models with GARCH errors. A popular specification in this class is the (stationary) Smooth Transition Autoregressive-GARCH (STAR-GARCH) model. Little is presently known about the structure of the model, or the consistency, asymptotic normality and finite sample properties of the estimators. The paper develops the structural and statistical properties of the STAR-GARCH model, and investigates the finite sample properties of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of STAR and STAR-GARCH models through numerical simulation. The effects of fixing the threshold value and|or the transition rate for the STAR model, misspecification of the conditional mean and the transition function of the STAR-GARCH model, and the finite sample properties of the MLE for the STAR-GARCH model, are also examined. These numerical results are used as a guide in empirical research, with an application to Standard and Poor's Composite 500 Index returns for alternative STAR-GARCH models.

However, the statistical properties of the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimator of the EGARCH parameters are not available under general conditions, but rather only for special cases under highly restrictive and unverifiable conditions.

The journals are ranked using quantifiable static and dynamic Research Assessment Measures (RAMs), with 15 RAMs from ISI and five RAMs from RePEc.

Such a risk management strategy is robust to the GFC in the sense that, while maintaining the same risk management strategy before, during and after a financial crisis, it will lead to comparatively low daily capital charges and violation penalties for the entire period. This paper presents evidence to support the claim that the median point forecast of VaR is generally GFC-robust. We investigate the performance of a variety of single and combined VaR forecasts in terms of daily capital requirements and violation penalties under the Basel II Accord, as well as other criteria.

Backtesting is performed on each of these indexes using the Basel II Accord regulations for 2008-10 to examine the performance of the Median strategy in terms of the number of violations and daily capital charges, among other criteria.

As financial applications typically deal with a portfolio of assets and risk, there are several multivariate GARCH models which specify the risk of one asset as depending on its own past as well as the past behaviour of other assets. Multivariate effects, whereby the risk of a given asset depends on the previous risk of any other asset, are termed spillover effects. In this paper we analyse the importance of considering spillover effects when forecasting financial volatility. The forecasting performance of the VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003), which includes spillover effects from all assets, the CCC model of Bollerslev (1990), which includes no spillovers, and a new Portfolio Spillover GARCH (PS-GARCH) model, which accommodates aggregate spillovers parsimoniously and hence avoids the so-called curse of dimensionality, are compared using a VaR example for a portfolio containing four international stock market indices. The empirical results suggest that spillover effects are statistically significant. However, the VaR threshold forecasts are generally found to be insensitive to the inclusion of spillover effects in any of the multivariate models considered.

The two leading tourism countries for Taiwan are Japan and USA, which are sources of short and long haul tourism, respectively. As a strong domestic currency can have adverse effects on international tourist arrivals through the price effect, daily data from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2008 are used to model the world price, exchange rates, and tourist arrivals from the world, USA and Japan to Taiwan, and their associated volatility. Inclusion of the exchange rate and its volatility captures approximate daily and weekly price and price volatility effects on world, US and Japanese tourist arrivals to Taiwan. The Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model is used to approximate the slowly decaying correlations associated with the long memory properties in daily and weekly exchange rates and international tourist arrivals, to test whether alternative short and long run estimates of conditional volatility are sensitive to the long memory in the conditional mean, to examine asymmetry and leverage in volatility, and to examine the effects of temporal and spatial aggregation. The approximate price and price volatility effects tend to be different, with the exchange rate typically having the expected negative impact on tourist arrivals to Taiwan, whereas exchange rate volatility can have positive or negative effects on tourist arrivals to Taiwan. For policy purposes, the empirical results suggest that an arbitrary choice of data frequency or spatial aggregation will not lead to robust findings as they are generally not independent of the level of aggregation used.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpch286", "epmc90"], "abstractStem": "tourism is a major sourc of servic receipt for mani countri includ taiwan the two lead tourism countri for taiwan are japan and usa which are sourc of short and long haul tourism respect as a strong domest currenc can have advers effect on intern tourist arriv through the price effect daili data from 1 januari 1990 to 31 decemb 2008 are use to model the world price exchang rate and tourist arriv from the world usa and japan to taiwan and their associ volatil inclus of the exchang rate and it volatil captur approxim daili and weekli price and price volatil effect on world us and japanes tourist arriv to taiwan the heterogen autoregress har model is use to approxim the slowli decay correl associ with the long memori properti in daili and weekli exchang rate and intern tourist arriv to test whether altern short and long run estim of condit volatil are sensit to the long memori in the condit mean to examin asymmetri and leverag in volatil and to examin the effect of tempor and spatial aggreg the approxim price and price volatil effect tend to be differ with the exchang rate typic have the expect neg impact on tourist arriv to taiwan wherea exchang rate volatil can have posit or neg effect on tourist arriv to taiwan for polici purpos the empir result suggest that an arbitrari choic of data frequenc or spatial aggreg will not lead to robust find as they are gener not independ of the level of aggreg usedpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Aggregation, Heterogeneous Autoregression And Volatility Of Daily International Tourist Arrivals And Exchange Rates"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/matcom/v81y2011i6p1153-1160.html": {"abstract": "This paper develops a new test, the trinomial test, for pairwise ordinal data samples to improve the power of the sign test by modifying its treatment of zero differences between observations, thereby increasing the use of sample information.

The variable addition testing method of McAleer (1983) for single equations is extended to vectors of equations in which the dependent variables of competing systems are subject to non-linear data transformations. An appealing feature of the variable addition testing procedure is that it accommodates the adding-up condition in a straight-forward manner. Annual data over the period 1921-1981 for The Netherlands for four major groups of consumer expenditure are used in the empirical application. It is found that no single system is dominant in explaining the data.

China's increasing integration into the global market may have important consequences for investors in related markets. In order to capture these potential effects, we explore these issues using an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) return equation. A univariate GARCH model is then adopted to test for the persistence of volatility in stock market returns, as represented by stock market indices. Finally, univariate GARCH, multivariate VARMA\u2013GARCH, and multivariate VARMA\u2013AGARCH models are used to test for constant conditional correlations and volatility spillover effects across these markets. Each model is used to calculate the conditional volatility between both the Shenzhen and Shanghai Chinese markets and several other markets around the Pacific Basin Area, including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore, during four distinct periods, beginning 27 August 1991 and ending 17 November 2010. The empirical results show some evidence of volatility spillovers across these markets in the pre-GFC periods, but there is little evidence of spillover effects from China to related markets during the GFC. We undertook some additional analysis for this period featuring an exploration of whether there was any spillover effect in the mean equations as well as in the variance equations. We used a bimean equation to model the conditional mean in the individual markets plus an ARMA model to capture volatility spillovers from China to the five markets considered. This augmented model showed much greater evidence of spillovers.

In periods of contagion, wherein the number and values of extremes are substantially greater, the use of the median would be expected to be even more robust than the mean.

Such models might be expected to be useful in explaining financial data, especially in the presence of extreme shocks that arise during a GFC.

This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U.S. Treasury benchmarks and related debt instruments by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other debt instruments for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of debt instruments are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the debt instrument shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the debt instrument yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other debt instruments should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between debt instruments, with implications for portfolio composition.

Under the assumption of exogeneity, the standard method of estimation is nonlinear least squares. The primary purpose of this paper is to relax the assumption of weakly exogenous regressors and to discuss moment-based methods for estimating STR models. The paper analyzes the properties of the STR model with endogenous variables by providing a diagnostic test of linearity of the underlying process under endogeneity, developing an estimation procedure and a misspecification test for the STR model, presenting the results of Monte Carlo simulations to show the usefulness of the model and estimation method, and providing an empirical application for inflation rate targeting in Brazil.

However, the DCC estimates of the conditional correlations are always significant. This result makes it clear that the assumption of constant conditional correlations is not supported empirically. Surprisingly, the empirical results from the VARMA-GARCH and VARMA-AGARCH models provide little evidence of volatility spillovers between the crude oil and financial markets.

The importance of country ratings is underscored by the existence of several major country risk rating agencies, namely the Economist Intelligence Unit, Euromoney, Institutional Investor, International Country Risk Guide, Moody's, Political Risk Services, and Standard and Poor's. These risk rating agencies employ different methods to determine country risk ratings, combining a range of qualitative and quantitative information regarding alternative measures of economic, financial and political risk into associated composite risk ratings. However, the accuracy of any risk rating agency with regard to any or all of these measures is open to question. For this reason, it is necessary to review the literature relating to empirical country risk models according to established statistical and econometric criteria used in estimation, evaluation and forecasting. Such an evaluation permits a critical assessment of the relevance and practicality of the country risk literature. The paper also provides an international comparison of risk ratings for twelve countries from six geographic regions. These ratings are compiled by the International Country Risk Guide, which is the only rating agency to provide detailed and consistent monthly data over an extended period for a large number of countries.

The primary purpose of this paper is to analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between BEKK and DCC, both with and without targeting, on the basis of the structural derivation of the models, the availability of analytical forms for the sufficient conditions for existence of moments, sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the appropriate estimators, and computational tractability for ultra large numbers of financial assets. Based on theoretical considerations, the paper sheds light on how to discriminate between BEKK and DCC in practical applications.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpca441", "epmc90"], "abstractStem": "the manag and monitor of veri larg portfolio of financi asset are routin for mani individu and organ the two most wide use model of condit covari and correl in the class of multivari garch model are bekk and dcc it is well known that bekk suffer from the archetyp curs of dimension wherea dcc doe not it is argu in thi paper that thi is a mislead interpret of the suitabl of the two model for use in practic the primari purpos of thi paper is to analyz the similar and dissimilar between bekk and dcc both with and without target on the basi of the structur deriv of the model the avail of analyt form for the suffici condit for exist of moment suffici condit for consist and asymptot normal of the appropri estim and comput tractabl for ultra larg number of financi asset base on theoret consider the paper shed light on how to discrimin between bekk and dcc in practic applicationspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Do We Really Need Both Bekk And Dcc?

In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric stochastic volatility model, based on the leverage and size effects. The model is a generalization of the exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model of Nelson (1991). We consider categories for asymmetric effects, which describes the difference among the asymmetric effect of the EGARCH model, the threshold effects indicator function of Glosten et al. (1992), and the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. The new model is estimated by the efficient importance sampling method of Liesenfeld and Richard (2003), and the finite sample properties of the estimator are investigated using numerical simulations. Four financial time series are used to estimate the alternative asymmetric stochastic volatility (SV) models, with empirical asymmetric effects found to be statistically significant in each case. The empirical results for S&amp;P; 500 and Yen/USD returns indicate that the leverage and size effects are significant, supporting the general model. For Tokyo stock price index (TOPIX) and USD/AUD returns, the size effect is insignificant, favoring the negative correlation between the innovations in returns and volatility. We also consider standardized t distribution for capturing the tail behavior. The results for Yen/USD returns show that the model is correctly specified, while the results for three other data sets suggest there is scope for improvement.", "authors": ["epas73", "epmc90"], "abstractStem": " the stochast volatil model usual incorpor asymmetr effect by introduc the neg correl between the innov in return and volatil in thi paper we propos a new asymmetr stochast volatil model base on the leverag and size effect the model is a gener of the exponenti garch egarch model of nelson 1991 we consid categori for asymmetr effect which describ the differ among the asymmetr effect of the egarch model the threshold effect indic function of glosten et al 1992 and the neg correl between the innov in return and volatil the new model is estim by the effici import sampl method of liesenfeld and richard 2003 and the finit sampl properti of the estim are investig use numer simul four financi time seri are use to estim the altern asymmetr stochast volatil sv model with empir asymmetr effect found to be statist signific in each case the empir result for sampp 500 and yenusd return indic that the leverag and size effect are signific support the gener model for tokyo stock price index topix and usdaud return the size effect is insignific favor the neg correl between the innov in return and volatil we also consid standard t distribut for captur the tail behavior the result for yenusd return show that the model is correctli specifi while the result for three other data set suggest there is scope for improv", "title": "Alternative Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Models"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pacfin/v16y2008i4p453-475.html": {"abstract": "This paper analyses the time-varying conditional correlations between Chinese A and B share returns using the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model of Engle [Engle, R.F.

The results show that the conditional correlations increased substantially following the B share market reform, whereby Chinese investors were permitted to purchase B shares. However, this increase in correlations was found to have begun well before the B share market reform. This result has significant implication relating to the structure of the information flow between the markets for the two classes of shares. Value-at-Risk (VaR) threshold forecasts are used to analyse the importance of accommodating dynamic conditional correlations between Chinese A and B shares, and thus reflects the impact of the changes in information flow on the risk evaluation of a diversified portfolio.

The model of inference used here relates Bayesian inference to algorithmic information theory. Simplicity is examined in the light of induction, the Duhem-Quine thesis, and bounded rationality.
