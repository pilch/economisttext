These investigations demonstrate that when there is significant serial correlation, there are systematic finite sample biases in the nominal size and power of these test statistics. The direction of the bias is toward rejection of the null model, although it varies considerably by the type of test and estimation technique.

In addition, the extended rise in US house prices was likely also supported by long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates) that were surprisingly low, given the level of short-term rates and other macro fundamentals \u2013a development that Greenspan (2005) dubbed a \u201cconundrum.\u201d The \u201cglobal saving glut\u201d (GSG) hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005 and 2007) argues that increased capital inflows to the United States from countries in which desired saving greatly exceeded desired investment \u2013including Asian emerging markets and commodity exporters\u2013 were an important reason that US longer-term interest rates during this period were lower than expected. This essay investigates further the effects of capital inflows to the United States on US longer-term interest rates; however, we look beyond the overall size of the inflows emphasised by the GSG hypothesis to examine the implications for US yields of the portfolio preferences of foreign creditors. We present evidence that, in the spirit of Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009), foreign investors during this period tended to prefer US assets perceived to be safe. In particular, foreign investors \u2013especially the GSG countries\u2013acquired a substantial share of the new issues of US Treasuries, Agency debt, and Agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities. The downward pressure on yields exerted by inflows from the GSG countries was reinforced by the portfolio preferences of other foreign investors. We focus particularly on the case of Europe: although Europe did not run a large current account surplus as did the GSG countries, we show that it leveraged up its international balance sheet, issuing external liabilities to finance substantial purchases of apparently safe US \u201cprivate label\u201d mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income products. The strong demand for apparently safe assets by both domestic and foreign investors not only served to reduce yields on these assets but also provided additional incentives for the US financial services industry to develop structured investment products that \u201ctransformed\u201d risky loans into highly-rated securities. Our findings do not challenge the view that domestic factors, including those listed above, were the primary sources of the housing boom and bust in the United States.

An interesting possibility is that the central bank might target current private-sector forecasts of inflation, either those made explicitly by professional forecasters or those implicit in asset prices. We address the issue of existence and uniqueness of rational expectations equilibria when the central bank uses private-sector forecasts as a guide to policy actions. In a dynamic model which incorporates both sluggish price adjustment and shocks to aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we show that strict targeting of inflation forecasts is typically inconsistent with the existence of rational expectations equilibrium, and that policies approximating strict inflation-forecast targeting are likely to have undesirable properties. We also show that economies with more general forecast-based policy rules are particularly susceptible to indeterminacy of rational expectations equilibria.

The complexity of the problems has in some instances required situation-specific responses. Enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, especially the Troubled Asset Relief Program, is an important step to deal with a systemic financial problem of historic dimensions. Fortunately, economic policymakers have learned the lessons of history and have intervened while the majority of financial institutions still have adequate capital and liquidity to provide credit to the economy. Timely government intervention, together with the natural recuperative power of financial markets, will lay the groundwork for financial and economic recovery.Business Economics (2008) 43, 8\u201312; doi:10.2145/20080401", "authors": ["epbe55"], "abstractStem": "although the feder reserv strongli favor privatesector solut to privatesector problem the risk of financi instabl in the unit state and in much of the rest of the world ha impli the need to take extraordinari action on the part of govern and central bank the complex of the problem ha in some instanc requir situationspecif respons enact of the emerg econom stabil act especi the troubl asset relief program is an import step to deal with a system financi problem of histor dimens fortun econom policymak have learn the lesson of histori and have interven while the major of financi institut still have adequ capit and liquid to provid credit to the economi time govern intervent togeth with the natur recup power of financi market will lay the groundwork for financi and econom recoverybusi econom 2008 43 8 12 doi10214520080401", "title": "Current Economic and Financial Conditions"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v50y2003i3p525-546.html": {"abstract": "Most empirical analyses of monetary policy have been confined to frameworks in which the Federal Reserve is implicitly assumed to exploit only a limited amount of information, despite the fact that the Fed actively monitors literally thousands of economic time series. This article explores the feasibility of incorporating richer information sets into the analysis, both positive and normative, of Fed policymaking. We employ a factor-model approach, developed by Stock and Watson (1999a,b), that permits the systematic information in large data sets to be summarized by relatively few estimated factors. With this framework, we reconfirm Stock and Watson's result that the use of large data sets can improve forecast accuracy, and we show that this result does not seem to depend on the use of finally revised (as opposed to 'real-time') data. We estimate policy reaction functions for the Fed that take into account its data-rich environment and provide a test of the hypothesis that Fed actions are explained solely by its forecasts of inflation and real activity. Finally, we explore the possibility of developing an 'expert system' that could aggregate diverse information and provide benchmark policy settings.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epbe55", "epbo43"], "abstractStem": "most empir analys of monetari polici have been confin to framework in which the feder reserv is implicitli assum to exploit onli a limit amount of inform despit the fact that the fed activ monitor liter thousand of econom time seri thi articl explor the feasibl of incorpor richer inform set into the analysi both posit and norm of fed policymak we employ a factormodel approach develop by stock and watson 1999ab that permit the systemat inform in larg data set to be summar by rel few estim factor with thi framework we reconfirm stock and watson result that the use of larg data set can improv forecast accuraci and we show that thi result doe not seem to depend on the use of final revis as oppos to realtim data we estim polici reaction function for the fed that take into account it datarich environ and provid a test of the hypothesi that fed action are explain sole by it forecast of inflat and real activ final we explor the possibl of develop an expert system that could aggreg divers inform and provid benchmark polici settingspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Monetary policy in a data-rich environment"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/crcspp/v49y1998ip149-194.html": {"abstract": "The propositions that monetary expansion lowers short-term nominal interest rates (the liquidity effect), and that monetary policy does not have long-run real effects (long-run neutrality), are widely accepted, yet to date the empirical evidence for both is mixed.
