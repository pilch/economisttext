We document that wage inequality in the top half of distribution has displayed an unchecked and rather smooth secular rise for the last 25 years (since 1980). Wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution also grew rapidly from 1979 to 1987, but it has ceased growing (and for some measures actually narrowed) since the late 1980s. Furthermore we find that occupational employment growth shifted from monotonically increasing in wages (education) in the 1980s to a pattern of more rapid growth in jobs at the top and bottom relative to the middles of the wage (education) distribution in the 1990s. We characterize these patterns as the %u201Cpolarization%u201D of the U.S. labor market, with employment polarizing into high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-wage work.

The lowest quintile of the consumption distribution received 0.9 percentage points less of total consumption in 1988 than in 1980; the corresponding decline for income was 0.6 percentage points. Second. broad conclusions concerning recent changes in the consumption distribution are not very sensitive to the exact choice of a measure of family needs.

Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we find limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality-which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition-and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the first half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills-attributable to skill-biased technical change-and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent \"polarization\" of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.

Four to seven years after random assignment, families offered vouchers lived in safer neighborhoods that had lower poverty rates than those of the control group not offered vouchers. We find no significant overall effects of this intervention on adult economic self-sufficiency or physical health. Mental health benefits of the voucher offers for adults and for female youth were substantial. Beneficial effects for female youth on education, risky behavior, and physical health were offset by adverse effects for male youth. For outcomes that exhibit significant treatment effects, we find, using variation in treatment intensity across voucher types and cities, that the relationship between neighborhood poverty rate and outcomes is approximately linear.

For-profit enrollment increased from 0.2 percent to 9.1 percent of total enrollment in degree-granting schools from 1970 to 2009, and for-profit institutions account for the majority of enrollments in non-degree-granting postsecondary schools. We describe the schools, students, and programs in the for-profit higher education sector, its phenomenal recent growth, and its relationship to the federal and state governments. Using the 2004 to 2009 Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) longitudinal survey, we assess outcomes of a recent cohort of first-time undergraduates who attended for-profits relative to comparable students who attended community colleges or other public or private non-profit institutions. We find that relative to these other institutions, for-profits educate a larger fraction of minority, disadvantaged, and older students, and they have greater success at retaining students in their first year and getting them to complete short programs at the certificate and AA levels. But we also find that for-profit students end up with higher unemployment and \"idleness\" rates and lower earnings six years after entering programs than do comparable students from other schools and that, not surprisingly, they have far greater default rates on their loans.", "authors": ["fpde497", "fpgo601", "fpka266"], "abstractStem": "privat forprofit institut have been the fastestgrow part of the us higher educ sector forprofit enrol increas from 02 percent to 91 percent of total enrol in degreegr school from 1970 to 2009 and forprofit institut account for the major of enrol in nondegreegr postsecondari school we describ the school student and program in the forprofit higher educ sector it phenomen recent growth and it relationship to the feder and state govern use the 2004 to 2009 begin postsecondari student bp longitudin survey we assess outcom of a recent cohort of firsttim undergradu who attend forprofit rel to compar student who attend commun colleg or other public or privat nonprofit institut we find that rel to these other institut forprofit educ a larger fraction of minor disadvantag and older student and they have greater success at retain student in their first year and get them to complet short program at the certif and aa level but we also find that forprofit student end up with higher unemploy and idl rate and lower earn six year after enter program than do compar student from other school and that not surprisingli they have far greater default rate on their loan", "title": "The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector: Nimble Critters or Agile Predators?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v13y1999i1p37-62.html": {"abstract": "The authors trace the origins of the key features of U.S. higher education today--the coexistence of small liberal arts colleges and large research universities; the substantial share of enrollment in the public sector; and varying levels of support provided by the states.

The trust fund represents what a worker loses if dismissed from a job for shirking. In considering whether to work or shirk, a worker weighs the potential loss due to forfeiture of the trust fund if caught shirking against the benefits from reduced effort. This concept is used to show that the implicit bonding in upward sloping age-earnings profiles is not a perfect substitute for an explicit up-front performance bond (or employment fee). It is also shown that the second-best optimal earnings profile in the absence of an up-front employment fee pays total compensation in excess of market clearing in a variety of stylized cases.", "authors": ["fpka266"], "abstractStem": "thi paper defin a concept a worker trust fund which is use in analyz optim ageearn profil the trust fund repres what a worker lose if dismiss from a job for shirk in consid whether to work or shirk a worker weigh the potenti loss due to forfeitur of the trust fund if caught shirk against the benefit from reduc effort thi concept is use to show that the implicit bond in upward slope ageearn profil is not a perfect substitut for an explicit upfront perform bond or employ fee it is also shown that the secondbest optim earn profil in the absenc of an upfront employ fee pay total compens in excess of market clear in a varieti of styliz case", "title": "Workers' Trust Funds and the Logic of Wage Profiles"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedbrr/y2001iq4p5-11nv.11no.4.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpgo601", "fpka266"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The shaping of higher education in the United States and New England"}}}
