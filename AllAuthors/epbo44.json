Dollarization is modeled as a fixed real exchange rate and also as a potentially increased inflow of capital from abroad. The effects of dollarization depend upon whether adopting a fixed exchange reduces the rate of return on emigration and helps to attract foreign capital. The paper investigates how Mexican emigration to the United States responds to changes in bilateral economic conditions. The evidence indicates that the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico into the United States is sensitive to economic conditions and is more volatile when the Mexican monetary authorities have fixed the exchange rate in the past. In contrast, the legal immigrant flow is not sensitive to changes in relative economic conditions.", "authors": ["epbo44"], "abstractStem": " thi paper examin how dollar affect wage and employ in the mexican labor market dollar is model as a fix real exchang rate and also as a potenti increas inflow of capit from abroad the effect of dollar depend upon whether adopt a fix exchang reduc the rate of return on emigr and help to attract foreign capit the paper investig how mexican emigr to the unit state respond to chang in bilater econom condit the evid indic that the flow of illeg immigr from mexico into the unit state is sensit to econom condit and is more volatil when the mexican monetari author have fix the exchang rate in the past in contrast the legal immigr flow is not sensit to chang in rel econom condit", "title": "Dollarization and the Mexican Labor Market"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jhecon/v22y2003i6p933-958.html": {"abstract": "Although the 1996 welfare reform legislation limited the eligibility of immigrant households to receive assistance, many states chose to protect their immigrant populations by offering state-funded aid to these groups.
