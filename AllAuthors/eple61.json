The law and finance theory holds that legal traditions differ in terms of the priority they attach to protecting the rights of private investors vis-a-vis the State and this has important implications for financial development. The endowment theory argues that the disease and geographical environment influence the formation of long-lasting institutions that influence financial development. Using a sample of former colonies, we explore whether the legal system brought by colonizers and/or the initial disease/geographical endowments encountered by colonizers explain financial development today. The empirical results indicate that both the legal systems brought by colonizers and the initial endowments in the colonies are important determinants of stock market development and private property rights protection.

This idea was the basis for the theory\"capital fundamentalism.\"Under this view, differences in national stocks of capital were the primary determinants of differences in levels of national product. Capital fundamentalists viewed capital accumulation as central to increasing the rate of economic growth. Evidence to support this view was based mostly on case studies of less developed countries. Neoclassical growth theory and growth accounting research indicated that differences in patterns of investment and capital formation were not the main factors that led nations to be rich or poor, fast-growing or slow. Technology, rather than capital accumulation, appeared to drive improvements in living standards in the long run. Evidence to support this view was based mostly on data from advanced countries. Recent research on growth and development has lent support to two conclusions that capital fundamentalists would find attractive: that differences in national patterns of physical capital accumulation can explain many differences in levels of national product, and that increases in national investment rates can produce major increases in rates of economic growth. The authors find that although the capital-output ratio varies positively with the level of per capita income, there is little support for the view that capital fundamentalism should guide the agenda for research and policy advice. Extending standard growth accounting procedures to a broad sample of 105 countries, they find: 1) differences in capital-per-person explain few of the differences in output-per-person across countries; 2) growth in capital stocks account for little of output growth across countries; and 3) the ratio of investment to Gross Domestic Product is strongly associated with economic growth - but there is more reason to believe that economic growth causes investment and s<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epki21", "eple61"], "abstractStem": "few econom idea are as intuit as the notion that increas invest is the best way to rais futur output thi idea wa the basi for the theorycapit fundamentalismund thi view differ in nation stock of capit were the primari determin of differ in level of nation product capit fundamentalist view capit accumul as central to increas the rate of econom growth evid to support thi view wa base mostli on case studi of less develop countri neoclass growth theori and growth account research indic that differ in pattern of invest and capit format were not the main factor that led nation to be rich or poor fastgrow or slow technolog rather than capit accumul appear to drive improv in live standard in the long run evid to support thi view wa base mostli on data from advanc countri recent research on growth and develop ha lent support to two conclus that capit fundamentalist would find attract that differ in nation pattern of physic capit accumul can explain mani differ in level of nation product and that increas in nation invest rate can produc major increas in rate of econom growth the author find that although the capitaloutput ratio vari posit with the level of per capita incom there is littl support for the view that capit fundament should guid the agenda for research and polici advic extend standard growth account procedur to a broad sampl of 105 countri they find 1 differ in capitalperperson explain few of the differ in outputperperson across countri 2 growth in capit stock account for littl of output growth across countri and 3 the ratio of invest to gross domest product is strongli associ with econom growth  but there is more reason to believ that econom growth caus invest and spthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Capital fundamentalism, economic development, and economic growth"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v50y2003i1p3-39.html": {"abstract": "Does economic development depend on geographic endowments like temperate instead of tropical location, the ecological conditions shaping diseases, or an environment good for grains or certain cash crops?

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 To draw conclusions about the policy determinants of the crisis, the paper studies five important policies: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) policies toward credit rating agencies, Federal Reserve policies concerning bank capital and credit default swaps, SEC and Federal Reserve policies about over-the-counter derivatives, SEC policies toward the consolidated supervision of major investment banks, and government policies toward two housing-finance entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Findings \u2013 The evidence is inconsistent with the view that the collapse of the financial system was caused only by the popping of the housing bubble (\u201caccident\u201d) and the herding behavior of financiers rushing to create and market increasingly complex and questionable financial products (\u201csuicide\u201d). Rather, the evidence indicates that senior policymakers repeatedly designed, implemented, and maintained policies that destabilized the global financial system in the decade before the crisis. Moreover, although the major regulatory agencies were aware of the growing fragility of the financial system due to their policies, they chose not to modify those policies, suggesting that \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d contributed to the financial system's collapse. Originality/value \u2013 Although influential policymakers presume that international capital flows, euphoric traders, and insufficient regulatory power caused the crisis, this paper shows that these factors played only a partial role.
