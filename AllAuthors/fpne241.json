The second step is the estimation of the primary equation via nonparametric regression with the reduced form residuals included as a regressor.

One partially adaptive estimator performs especially well when the errors are skewed, while another partially adaptive estimator and RLS perform particularly well when the errors are extremely leptokur-totic.
