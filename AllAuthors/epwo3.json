Rotemberg and Woodford (1997) and Woodford (2002) have shown that under certain conditions, a local approximation to the expected utility of the representative household in a model of this kind is related inversely to the expected discounted value of a conventional quadratic loss function, in which each period's loss is a weighted average of squared deviations of inflation and an output gap measure from their optimal values (zero). However, those derivations rely on an assumption of the existence of an output or employment subsidy that offsets the distortion due to the market power of monopolis-tically competitive price-setters, so that the steady state under a zero-inflation policy involves an efficient level of output. Here we show how to dispense with this unappealing assumption, so that a valid linear-quadratic approximation to the optimal policy problem is possible even when the steady state is distorted to an arbitrary extent (allowing for tax distortions as well as market power), and when, as a consequence, it is necessary to take account of the effects of stabilization policy on the average level of output. We again obtain a welfare-theoretic loss function that involves both inflation and an appropriately defined output gap, though the degree of distortion of the steady state affects both the weights on the two stabilization objectives and the definition of the welfare-relevant output gap. In the light of these results, we reconsider the conditions under which complete price stability is optimal, and find that they are more restrictive in the case of a distorted steady state. We also consider the conditions under which pure randomization of monetary policy can be welfare-improving, and find that this is possible in the case of a sufficiently distorted steady state, though the parameter values required are probably not empirically realistic.

An interesting possibility is that the central bank might target current private-sector forecasts of inflation, either those made explicitly by professional forecasters or those implicit in asset prices. We address the issue of existence and uniqueness of rational expectations equilibria when the central bank uses private-sector forecasts as a guide to policy actions. In a dynamic model which incorporates both sluggish price adjustment and shocks to aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we show that strict targeting of inflation forecasts is typically inconsistent with the existence of rational expectations equilibrium, and that policies approximating strict inflation-forecast targeting are likely to have undesirable properties. We also show that economies with more general forecast-based policy rules are particularly susceptible to indeterminacy of rational expectations equilibria. We conclude that, although private-sector forecasts may contain information useful to the central bank, ultimately the monetary authorities must rely on an explicit structural model of the economy to guide their policy decisions.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epbe55", "epwo3"], "abstractStem": "propos for inflat target as a strategi for monetari polici leav open the import oper question of how to determin whether current polici are consist with the longrun inflat target an interest possibl is that the central bank might target current privatesector forecast of inflat either those made explicitli by profession forecast or those implicit in asset price we address the issu of exist and uniqu of ration expect equilibria when the central bank use privatesector forecast as a guid to polici action in a dynam model which incorpor both sluggish price adjust and shock to aggreg demand and aggreg suppli we show that strict target of inflat forecast is typic inconsist with the exist of ration expect equilibrium and that polici approxim strict inflationforecast target are like to have undesir properti we also show that economi with more gener forecastbas polici rule are particularli suscept to indeterminaci of ration expect equilibria we conclud that although privatesector forecast may contain inform use to the central bank ultim the monetari author must reli on an explicit structur model of the economi to guid their polici decisionspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Inflation forecasts and monetary policy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fednep/y2002imayp85-94nv.8no.1.html": {"abstract": "Paper for a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York entitled Financial Innovation and Monetary Transmission", "authors": ["epwo3"], "abstractStem": "paper for a confer sponsor by the feder reserv bank of new york entitl financi innov and monetari transmiss", "title": "Financial market efficiency and the effectiveness of monetary policy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v100y1992i6p1153-1207.html": {"abstract": " The authors construct a dynamic general equilibrium model in which the typical industry colludes by threatening to punish deviations from an implicitly agreed-on pricing path.

This paper considers the role of such communication in the successful conduct of monetary policy, with a particular emphasis on an issue that remains controversial: to what extent is it desirable for central banks to comment on the likely path of short-term interest rates? After reviewing general arguments for and against central-bank transparency, the paper considers two specific contexts in which central banks have been forced to consider how much they are willing to say about the future path of interest rates. The first is the experiment with policy signaling by the FOMC in the U.S., using the statement released following each Committee meeting, since August 2003. The second is the need to make some assumption about future policy when producing the projections (for future inflation and other variables) that are central to inflation-forecast targeting procedures, of the kind used by the Bank of England, the Swedish Riksbank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and others. In both cases, it is argued that increased willingness to share the central bank's own assumptions about future policy with the public has increased the predictability of policy, in ways that are likely to have improved central bank's ability to achieve their stabilization objectives.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epwo3"], "abstractStem": "a notabl chang in central bank over the past 15 year ha been a worldwid movement toward increas commun by central bank about their polici decis the target that they seek to achiev through those decis and the central bank view of the economi like futur evolut thi paper consid the role of such commun in the success conduct of monetari polici with a particular emphasi on an issu that remain controversi to what extent is it desir for central bank to comment on the like path of shortterm interest rate after review gener argument for and against centralbank transpar the paper consid two specif context in which central bank have been forc to consid how much they are will to say about the futur path of interest rate the first is the experi with polici signal by the fomc in the us use the statement releas follow each committe meet sinc august 2003 the second is the need to make some assumpt about futur polici when produc the project for futur inflat and other variabl that are central to inflationforecast target procedur of the kind use by the bank of england the swedish riksbank the reserv bank of new zealand and other in both case it is argu that increas willing to share the central bank own assumpt about futur polici with the public ha increas the predict of polici in way that are like to have improv central bank abil to achiev their stabil objectivespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Central bank communication and policy effectiveness"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/macann/doi10.1086-674586.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["eppa21", "epwo3"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Editors' Introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v104y2014i5p495-500.html": {"abstract": "A model is proposed in which stochastic choice results from noise in cognitive processing rather than random variation in preferences.
