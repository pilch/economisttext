We show on measurement error grounds that this constraint should not be imposed in econometric work even when long run homogeneity of prices correctly characterizes the market. The constraint is rejected in the data. The second invalid constraint is that all explanatory variables have the same lag distribution. We argue that this constraint is invalid when decisions are made under uncertainty and find that it is also rejected by the data. The principal positive empirical finding is that with the constraints relaxed, the elasticity, of demand with respect to real wages is much larger than the estimates in the literature, indicating much greater price responsiveness on the demand side of the labor market than has previously been thought.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfr23"], "abstractStem": "thi paper investig the magnitud of the elast of demand for labor in time seri data use more gener and complet model of demand than have been previous employ it argu that previou analys have impos two invalid constraint in calcul which bia downward estim elast the first invalid constraint is the assumpt that real capit price have an equal opposit effect to real wage in the demand equat we show on measur error ground that thi constraint should not be impos in econometr work even when long run homogen of price correctli character the market the constraint is reject in the data the second invalid constraint is that all explanatori variabl have the same lag distribut we argu that thi constraint is invalid when decis are made under uncertainti and find that it is also reject by the data the princip posit empir find is that with the constraint relax the elast of demand with respect to real wage is much larger than the estim in the literatur indic much greater price respons on the demand side of the labor market than ha previous been thoughtpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "How Elastic is the Demand for Labor?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/wej/wldecn/17.html": {"abstract": "The main failure in the US economy in the 1980s through the mid 1990s was its inability to distribute the gains of economic growth to the bulk of the population.

Then using a stockflow relationship we look at how the organizing rate of new unions affects the overall density. A regression model assesses our interpretation of changes in Japanese density. Our principal findings are: (1) Structural shifts in the composition of employment and of the demographics of the work force account for only a modest proportion of the drop in Japanese density. As in the United States, most changes in density occur within industries and among defined demographic groups of workers. (2) Much of the decline in density is associated with the inability of Japanese unions to organize new establishments.

In the 1970s density rose steadily, making the United Kingdom the most heavily organized large OECD country. In the 1980s, by contrast, density fell by 1.4 percentage points per annum -- a faster drop than in the rapidly de-unionizing U.S. or in Japan. What explains this turnaround - the severe recession of the 1980s? Shifts in the composition of employment from unionized manufacturing to services? The Thatcher government's industrial relations legislation? In this paper we investigate these questions with a quantitative analysis of 1945-1986 changes in British union density. In contrast to studies that concentrate on cyclical determinants of unionism (Bain and Elshiekh, Carruth and Disney, Booth (1983)) we focus on industrial relations legislation. We develop an index of the favorableness of labor laws to unionism and relate it to changes in density in time series regressions that control for inflation, unemployment, and the manufacturing share of employment, among other variables. As a further test, we develop an analogous labor law index for Ireland, whose industrial relations system is similar to the U.K.'s and which experienced a similar severe 1980s recession but which did not pass new laws to weaken unions, and contrast changes in density between the countries with differences in industrial relations law. Our major finding is that the Thatcher government's labor laws caused much of the 1980s fall in British union density. We present the evidence for this claim in three stages. Section 1 lays out the facts of changing union density in the U.K. and Ireland and examines structural explanations of the U.K. changes.

China's massive investments in university education and research and development (R&amp;D;) have, in particular, made it a special partner for the United States in scientific work. These developments have substantial implications for US science and technology policy. This paper suggests that aligning immigration policies more closely to the influx of international students, granting fellowships to students working on turning scientific and technological advances into commercial innovations, and requiring firms with R&amp;D; tax credits or other government R&amp;D; funding develop \"impact plans\" to use their new knowledge to produce innovative products or processes in the United States could help the country adjust to the changing global world of science and technology.Globalization of knowledge, knowledge creation, and innovation has widened the framework for assessing the economic effects of science and technology (S&amp;T;) policies. As an advanced country at the frontier of knowledge, the United States relies on investments in science and technology to improve economic performance and maintain comparative advantage in the high-tech industries that employ highly educated workers. Expansion of tertiary education, increases in research and development spending, and the manufacturing and assembly of high-tech products in low-income countries as well as in other advanced countries challenges the US position at the knowledge frontier.1 This makes S&amp;T; policies more important in determining economic outcomes than in earlier post-World War II decades when the United States naturally dominated the production and application of knowledge to the economy.This paper analyzes the globalization of science and engineering and knowledge production in the twenty-first century and its implications for US science and technology policies.Section I documents the spread of advanced knowledge and knowledge creation around the world in terms of its impact on the US share of the world's science and engineering activity. It stresses that the rapid catch-up in knowledge-creating activities and production in low-wage developing countries, most notably China, constitutes a major challenge for the United States. The catch-up undermines the \"North-South\" model of trade that posited that advanced countries inevitably have comparative advantage in the production of high value-added innovations.2Section II shows that the catch-up has \"globalized\" science and engineering within the United States by increasing the foreign-born share of science and engineering graduate students and postdocs in US universities and the foreign-born share of the US's science and engineering workforce, and by spurring international collaborations in knowledge production and innovation, thereby speeding knowledge creation and the spread of new knowledge worldwide.Section III examines possible changes in US policies regarding international students, postdoctoral workers and science and engineering (S&amp;E;) immigrants, and regarding the link between technology-based innovations and production. It argues that globalization of knowledge makes S&amp;T; policies the \"industrial policy\" of the twenty-first century, with implications for economic performance broadly.

Because changes in the black share of voters in the post-World War II South are due largely to \"exogenous\" national laws (the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in particular), the paper provides a unique test of the impact of changes in political power on public decision making. The main finding is that increased black voting power appears to have raised demand for black schoolteachers in the 1960s. There is additional suggestive evidence that black voting power operated in part through election of black officials. The increase in demand due to the changes in voting offset most of the reduction in demand due to desegregation of schooling in the South, averting the potential dire effects of desegregated education on employment of black teachers. Instead of declining, relative employment of blacks in teaching was maintained, and relative incomes rose in the 1950s and 1960s.

Freeman of the London School of Economics, Harvard University and the NBER and David Card of the University of California at Berkeley and the NBER examine trends in productivity growth in Britain and other major developed countries and estimate the impact of British economic reforms on British performance. Freeman and Card find that developments in the UK economy cannot be readily explained by standard macro-economic changes in labour or capital. They note that economic reforms were more important in the UK than in other countries and that the UK after 1979 arrested the nearly century-long trend in economic decline of the UK relative to its historic competitors, France and Germany. They conclude that reforms in the area of union-management relations, privatization, profit and share ownership, and self-employment increased UK productivity growth 0.35 per cent per year over the 1979-1999 period, accounting for one quarter of the pick-up in productivity between the 1960-79 and 1979-1999 periods.", "authors": ["fpca271", "epfr23"], "abstractStem": "the uk economi ha undergon signific market reform over the last two decad a key question for product research is the impact of these reform on product growth in thi articl richard b freeman of the london school of econom harvard univers and the nber and david card of the univers of california at berkeley and the nber examin trend in product growth in britain and other major develop countri and estim the impact of british econom reform on british perform freeman and card find that develop in the uk economi cannot be readili explain by standard macroeconom chang in labour or capit they note that econom reform were more import in the uk than in other countri and that the uk after 1979 arrest the nearli centurylong trend in econom declin of the uk rel to it histor competitor franc and germani they conclud that reform in the area of unionmanag relat privat profit and share ownership and selfemploy increas uk product growth 035 per cent per year over the 19791999 period account for one quarter of the pickup in product between the 196079 and 19791999 period", "title": "What Have Two Decades of British Economic Reform Delivered in Terms of Productivity Growth?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/ilrrev/v44y1991i2p275-287.html": {"abstract": "Using establishment-level data from a variety of sources, this study documents and analyzes the consistent rise in interindustry wage dispersion in the United States between 1970 and 1987.

We find that (1) a substantial proportion of the variation of test scores within countries is associated with the school students attend; (2) a sizeable proportion of the school fixed effects is associated with school policies and teaching practices beyond national policies or other mechanisms that sort students of differing abilities among schools; (3) school fixed effects are a major pathway for the link between family background and test scores. The implication is that what schools do is important in the level and dispersion of test scores, suggesting the value of further analysis of what goes on in schools to pin down causal links between policies and practices and test score outcomes. \u2014 Richard B.

The proportion of American men incarcerated comes close to the proportion of European men long-term unemployed.

It recognizes three major errors of omission: failure to take account of unionism outside the US; failure to analyze public sector unionism; and failure to analyze the effects of unionism on economic growth; and the problem of determining the \"optimal level of unionism\" on the basis of estimates of what unions do. Ensuing research has found that What Do Unions Do? correctly identified union effects on turnover, fringe benefits, earnings inequality, political action, profits, managerial flexibility and human resource management, and that wage effects vary widely. Estimates of the union effect on productivity tend to be positive but modest, ruling out negative effects on average, but not conclusively establishing positive effects.
