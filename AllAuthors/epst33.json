It was hoped that Big Bang privatization would create the conditions for a demand-led evolution of legal institutions. But there was no theory to explain how this process of institutional evolution, including a legal framework for the protection of investors, would occur and, in fact, it has not yet occurred in Russia, in other former Soviet Union countries, in the Czech Republic, and elsewhere. A central reason for that, according to many scholars, is the weakness of the political demand for the rule of law. To shed light on this puzzle, the authors consider a model where the conditions for the emergence of the rule of law might be interpreted as highly favorable. Individuals with control rights over privatized assets can collectively bring about the rule of law simply by voting for it. These individuals are concerned with the wealth they can obtain from the privatized assets, and have two alternative strategies: building value and stripping assets. Building value under the rule of law yields higher benefits to a majority than stripping assets under no rule of law. But uncertainty about when the rule of law will be established may lead some individuals to choose an economic strategy-stripping assets, including converting corporate assets to private use-that gives them an interest in postponing the establishment of the rule of law. And therefore in the succeeding period, the rule of law may again not be in place, and so again individuals may strip assets. If they do, some of them may again have an interest in postponing the establishment of the rule of law. And so a weak demand for the rule of law can persist.

This paper analyzes optimal income taxation when consumers work for many periods. We also analyze what information, if any, that the government learns about abilities in one period can be used in later periods to attain more redistribution than in a one-period world. When the government must commit itself to future tax schedules, intertemporal nonstationarity of tax schedules could relax the self-selection constraints and lead to Pareto improvements. The effect of nonstationarity is analogous to that of randomization in one-period models. The use of information is limited since only a single lifetime self-selection constraint for each type of consumer exists.

Competition allocates resources efficiently and encourages innovation and attention to what customers want. Insurance markets differ from most other markets because in insurance markets competition can destroy the market rather than make it work better.One of the dimensions along which insurance companies compete is underwriting\u2014trying to ensure that the risks covered are \u201cgood\u201d risks or that if a high risk is insured, the premium charged is at least commensurate with the potential cost. The resulting partitioning of risk limits the amount of insurance that potential insurance customers can buy. In the extreme case, such competitive behavior will destroy the insurance market altogether. A simple model illustrates.

Accordingly,any analysis of the effects of capital taxation must focus on imperfect capital market.If individuals face limitations on the amounts which they can borrow and/or if there are limitations on short sales, then under some circumstances there is a locked - in effect (individuals do not sell securities which they would have sold inthe absence of taxation); but under other circumstances individuals are induced to sell securities that they otherwise would have held, in order to takea dvantage of the a symmetric treatment of short term losses and long term gains. A policy of realizing gains as soon as they become eligible for long term treatment dominates the policy of postponing the realization of capital gains,provided the gains are not too large.A simple general equilibrium model is constructed within which it is shown that the taxation of capital gains may increase the volatility of asset prices,and lead individuals not to trade when they otherwise would.While the analysis casts doubt on the significance of the welfare losses resulting from these exchange inefficiencies,there are circumstances in which the tax leads to production inefficiencies, e.g<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "the analysi of the effect ofcapit gain taxat requir a care model both of the detail of the tax code and the imperfect in the capit market under the standard assumpt concern perfect capit marketsand under the standard ideal of the tax code there are sever strategi by which ration investor can avoid not onli all tax on their capit incomethes strategi leav individu consumpt and bequest in each state of natur and at each date unchang from what they would have been in the absenc of taxesalthough certain detail provis of the tax code may limit the extent to which ration investor can avail themselv of these tax avoid activ there are way in a perfect capit market by which the effect of these restrict can be amelior accordinglyani analysi of the effect of capit taxat must focu on imperfect capit marketif individu face limit on the amount which they can borrow andor if there are limit on short sale then under some circumst there is a lock  in effect individu do not sell secur which they would have sold inth absenc of taxat but under other circumst individu are induc to sell secur that they otherwis would have held in order to takea dvantag of the a symmetr treatment of short term loss and long term gain a polici of realiz gain as soon as they becom elig for long term treatment domin the polici of postpon the realiz of capit gainsprovid the gain are not too largea simpl gener equilibrium model is construct within which it is shown that the taxat of capit gain may increas the volatil of asset pricesand lead individu not to trade when they otherwis wouldwhil the analysi cast doubt on the signific of the welfar loss result from these exchang inefficienciesther are circumst in which the tax lead to product ineffici egpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Some aspects of the taxation of capital gains"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/tek/journl/v2y2013i1p1-39.html": {"abstract": "The financial crisis and the Great Recession to which it gave rise exposed the deep flaws in standard macro-economic models, and in the way those models were deployed. In this paper, based on a talk given to the Turkish Economic Association in November 2012, Joseph E. Stiglitz discusses the range of these deficiencies and the ways in which the models must be re- formed. The paper first examines five particular issues in the current policy debate and explains why the standard model provides a misguided framework for addressing them. The paper identifies the fundamental flaws in the standard model, and argues that in trying to fine tune the models for \u201cnormal\u201d periods, it failed to address the more profound question of how to explain deep down- turns, including slow recoveries. A central lacuna is the lack of attention to credit and the institutions pro- viding it. It explains how a better understanding of banks would have led to better ways to recapitalize the banking system than those employed in the aftermath of the crisis.

In particular, the Japanese earthquake and its aftermath underlines three central shortcomings of our metrics: the measurement of the economic product,the measurement of well being, and the measurement of sustainability. For economists, these concerns are especially important, because we often rely on statistical (econometric analyses) to make inferences about what are good policies. Those inferences are only as reliable as the metrics that they are based on. Our statistical systems should tell us whether or not what we are doing is sustainable, economically, environmentally, politically, or socially and whether proposed policies will in fact enhance well-being .

We show that interdependencies in real and financial assets are beneficial from a social point of view when the economic environment is favorable and detrimental when the economic environment deteriorates. In the latter case, private incentives are such that too many linkages are formed, with respect to what is socially desirable. The risk of contagion increases the volatility of the outcome and thus reduces the ability of the financial networks to provide risk-sharing.Our analysis suggests that a likely major explanation of the subprime mortgage crisis is the process of securitization itself, in addition to the absence of transparency about the characteristics of the underlying assets that the multiple layers of financial intermediation fostered, as commonly claimed.This may call for a different emphasis on the role of public intervention.

But there are several puzzles that cannot be reconciled with standard models. These include: the apparent constancy in interest rates over extended periods, and changes at other times which appear unrelated to changes in technology and demography; the cyclical pattern of movements in real interest rates; the impact of nominal not real interest-rate changes on real variables; and the cyclical pattern of movements in interest-rate spreads. This paper reaches beyond the standard competitive equilibrium, perfect information, model of credit markets towards imperfect information models, particularly those that focus on the determinants of bank behaviour. Of the standard models, the money demand model is most deficient in understanding these puzzles. The loanable funds theory and a generalized version of real productivity theory can be reconciled with imperfect information, and markets and the consequent credit and equity rationing regimes help to explain the puzzles. Specifically, banks may be insensitive to changes in monetary stance owing to risk aversion. There are strong policy implications; it is argued, for instance, that in East Asia raising interest rates exacerbated economic decline and, rather than contributing to exchange-rate stability, may have induced capital flight as default risk increased, lowering risk-adjusted expected returns.

It puts forward a framework for a theory of adjustment, based on the portfolio theory of the riskaverse firm and the efficiency wage theory of labor markets. This is used to explain why in the onset of a downturn,the hiring rate may lag the layoff rate, thus giving rise to rising unemployment rates. It is also shown to provideguidance as to policies which enhance the ability of firms to bear risks and which reduce costs of hiring and firing.The paper argues that while policies which increase severance or layoff costs may be well intended they mayactually serve to exacerbate the magnitude of employment fluctuations. Similarly, unemployment compensation,which is designed to ease the burden on those who are unemployed, may lead to higher levels of equilibriumunemployment.

This procedure can be shown to be correct only in very special circumstances. This paper presents a very general characterization of the relationship between aggregate land rents and aggregate transport costs. In some special cases, the relationship turns out to be remarkably simple: for a circular city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are precisely twice aggregate land rents, independent of the distribution of tastes or income; for a linear city with linear transport costs, aggregate transport costs are equal to aggregate land rents. One corollary of our general analysis is that aggregate land rents may stay the same or actually fall in response to a transport improvement which makes everyone better off. In the first section we consider a simple example. The second derives the basic theorems of the paper, while the third examines their implications for the relationship between the benefits from a transport improvement and the change in aggregate land rents induced by the improvement. And in the fourth section, we examine the extent to which the theorems of section II generalize.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epar13", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "thi paper explor the relationship between aggreg land rent and aggreg transport cost for land market in which locat differ sole in term of access that there exist a relationship between land rent and transport cost ha been recogn at least sinc the time of von thunen the precis relationship between the two is howev not gener wellunderstood for instanc until quit recent it wa consid correct to estim the benefit from a transport improv by the induc chang in aggreg land rent at those locat where travel cost are reduc thi procedur can be shown to be correct onli in veri special circumst thi paper present a veri gener character of the relationship between aggreg land rent and aggreg transport cost in some special case the relationship turn out to be remark simpl for a circular citi with linear transport cost aggreg transport cost are precis twice aggreg land rent independ of the distribut of tast or incom for a linear citi with linear transport cost aggreg transport cost are equal to aggreg land rent one corollari of our gener analysi is that aggreg land rent may stay the same or actual fall in respons to a transport improv which make everyon better off in the first section we consid a simpl exampl the second deriv the basic theorem of the paper while the third examin their implic for the relationship between the benefit from a transport improv and the chang in aggreg land rent induc by the improv and in the fourth section we examin the extent to which the theorem of section ii generalizepthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Aggregate Land Rents and Aggregate Transport Costs"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v29y1986i1p1-24.html": {"abstract": "The central result of this paper is that when moral hazard ispresent,competitive equilibrium is almost always (constrained) inefficient.

For years, the dominant paradigm in macroeconomics, which assumed that income distribution did not matter, at least for macroeconomic behavior, ignored inequality\u2014both its role in causing crises and the effect of fluctuations in general, and crises in particular, on inequality. But the most recent financial crisis has shown the errors in this thinking, and these views are finally beginning to be questioned. Economists who had looked at the average equity of a homeowner\u2014ignoring the distribution\u2014felt comfortable that the economy could easily withstand a large fall in housing prices. When such a fall occurred, however, it had disastrous effects, because a large fraction of homeowners owed more on their homes than the value of the home, leading to waves of foreclosure and economic stress. Policy-makers and economists alike have begun to take note: inequality can contribute to volatility and the creation of crises, and volatility can contribute to inequality. Here, we explore the variety of channels through which inequality affects fluctuations and fluctuations affect inequality, and explore how some of the changes in our economy may have contributed to increased inequality and volatility both directly and indirectly. After describing the two-way relationship, the paper discusses hysteresis\u2014the fact that the consequences of an economic downturn can be long-lived. Then, it examines how policy can either mitigate or exacerbate the inequality consequences of economic downturns, and shows how well-intentioned policies can sometimes be counterproductive. Finally, it links these issues to human development, especially in developing countries.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": " thi paper examin the twoway relationship between inequ and econom fluctuat and the implic for human develop for year the domin paradigm in macroeconom which assum that incom distribut did not matter at least for macroeconom behavior ignor inequ both it role in caus crise and the effect of fluctuat in gener and crise in particular on inequ but the most recent financi crisi ha shown the error in thi think and these view are final begin to be question economist who had look at the averag equiti of a homeown ignor the distribut felt comfort that the economi could easili withstand a larg fall in hous price when such a fall occur howev it had disastr effect becaus a larg fraction of homeown owe more on their home than the valu of the home lead to wave of foreclosur and econom stress policymak and economist alik have begun to take note inequ can contribut to volatil and the creation of crise and volatil can contribut to inequ here we explor the varieti of channel through which inequ affect fluctuat and fluctuat affect inequ and explor how some of the chang in our economi may have contribut to increas inequ and volatil both directli and indirectli after describ the twoway relationship the paper discuss hysteresi the fact that the consequ of an econom downturn can be longliv then it examin how polici can either mitig or exacerb the inequ consequ of econom downturn and show how wellintent polici can sometim be counterproduct final it link these issu to human develop especi in develop countri", "title": "Macroeconomic Fluctuations, Inequality, and Human Development"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i6p851-66.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "On the Irrelevance of Corporate Financial Policy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v65y1975i3p283-300.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The Theory of \"Screening,\" Education, and the Distribution of Income"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedkpr/y1998p221-263.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Economic consequences of income inequality"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v72y1982i5p1121-30.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The Theory of Sales: A Simple Model of Equilibrium Price Dispersion with Identical Agents"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v44y1977i3p407-430..html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": [], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Monopoly, Non-linear Pricing and Imperfect Information: The Insurance Market"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jeicoo/v4y2009i2p195-212.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpde349", "epga109", "epru93", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Business fluctuations and bankruptcy avalanches in an evolving network economy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v10y1982i3-4p231-236.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epro48", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "A model of employment outcomes illustrating the effect of the structure of information on the level and distribution of income"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/epc/journl/v1y2006i1p6-9.html": {"abstract": "The article compares civil strife in the public arena to labor strikes in the private arena.

This tale is reminiscent of a similar tale concerning the Great Depression. In the 30s technical change was localized in agriculture, where income fell because rising productivity could not be offset by a shrinking labor force due to the costs of moving out of agriculture for unemployed workers, inelastic demand for agricultural output meant that as output increased income declined. As individual incomes fell below the level necessary to finance the transition to manufacturing, excess labor became trapped in agriculture, reducing wages and exacerbating the rise in output. Shrinking incomes in agriculture reverberated on the other sectors, mainly manufacturing causing a large depression. Nowadays, it is manufacturing that plays the role of epicenter of technical change. Falling incomes in manufacturing yield a lack of demand for goods produced in the rest of the economy, namely the service sector.

Money is important because of the relationship between money and credit. The process of judging credit worthiness, in which banks play a central role, involves the collection and processing of information. Like many other economic activities involving information, these processes are not well described by means of standard production functions. Changes in economic circumstances can have marked effects on the relevance of previously accumulated information and accordingly on the supply of credit. Changes in the availability of credit may have marked effects on the level of economic activity, while changes in real interest rates seem to play a relatively minor role in economic fluctuations.

Working in Washington, I quickly saw that although a few potential changes were strictly Pareto improvements, there were many other changes that would hurt only a small, narrowly defined group (for example, increasing the efficiency of the legal system might hurt lawyers). But if everyone except a narrowly defined special interest group could be shown to benefit, surely the change should be made. In practice, however, \"almost everyone\" was rarely sufficient in government policy-making and often such near-Pareto improvements did not occur. My major theme will be to provide a set of explanations for why this might be so. I shall put forward four hypotheses in this lecture, each of which provides part of the explanation for the failure in at least one instance of a proposed Pareto improvement.

Since the provision of insurance against firm-specific shocks adversely affects workers' incentives to search out better jobs, only partial insurance will be provided to encourage workers to stay (leave) at high (low) productivity firms: in this setting, quits and layoffs are alternative means of inducing separations at low productivity firms. This paper describes the equilibrium labour contract when search information is private, and is thereby able to provide the first unified treatment of risk-sharing contracts, interfirm mobility, worksharing, layoffs, severance pay, on-the-job and off-the-job search, quits and unemployment.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epar13", "epho15", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "firm inabl to monitor employe search effort result in a tradeoff between riskbear and incent consider in the design of employmentrel insur sinc the provis of insur against firmspecif shock advers affect worker incent to search out better job onli partial insur will be provid to encourag worker to stay leav at high low product firm in thi set quit and layoff are altern mean of induc separ at low product firm thi paper describ the equilibrium labour contract when search inform is privat and is therebi abl to provid the first unifi treatment of riskshar contract interfirm mobil workshar layoff sever pay onthejob and offthejob search quit and unemploymentpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Implicit Contracts, Labor Mobility, and Unemployment"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v83y1981i2p318-33.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": " Market Structure and Resource Extraction under Uncertainty"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedfpr/y1993imarx2.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Monetary policy and the theory of the risk-averse bank"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v49y1982i2p241-261..html": {"abstract": "This paper establishes that when there is not a complete set of markets but more than one commodity the stock market equilibrium will not in general be a constrained Pareto optimum.

It shows that a wide range of these models have similar implications for the likely reaction of firms to external environmental and policy changes. Two significant implications are (1) that firms behave as if they are risk averse individuals maximizing a utility function of terminal wealth (profitability) -- even when the risks involved are unsystematic -- and (2), in many circumstances, because this utility function is likely to be characterized by decreasing absolute risk aversion, firms are likely to respond significantly (and positively) to changes in cash flow and profitability. Together these two phenomena are able to account for a wide range of firm behaviors that have been empirically observed (both formally and informally) and that are difficult to explain in terms of the traditional theory of the firm. Furthermore, the responses of such firms to policy interventions are likely to differ significantly from those of neoclassical firms.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "thi paper summar recent develop in the theori of the firm that have arisen in examin the implic of imperfect inform it show that a wide rang of these model have similar implic for the like reaction of firm to extern environment and polici chang two signific implic are 1 that firm behav as if they are risk avers individu maxim a util function of termin wealth profit  even when the risk involv are unsystemat  and 2 in mani circumst becaus thi util function is like to be character by decreas absolut risk avers firm are like to respond significantli and posit to chang in cash flow and profit togeth these two phenomena are abl to account for a wide rang of firm behavior that have been empir observ both formal and inform and that are difficult to explain in term of the tradit theori of the firm furthermor the respons of such firm to polici intervent are like to differ significantli from those of neoclass firmspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Asymmetric Information and the New Theory of the Firm: Financial Constraints and Risk Behavior"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jetheo/v2y1970i3p225-243.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epro48", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Increasing risk: I.

This strand of literature holds that even if wages and prices were perfectly flexible, output and employment would be highly volatile. It sees the economy as amplifying the shocks that it experiences and making their effects persist. It identifies incomplete contracts, and, in particular, imperfect indexing, as central market failures, and it attempts both to explain the causes and consequences of these market failures. The models described here contain three basic ingredients: risk-averse firms; a credit allocation mechanism in which credit-rationing, risk-averse banks play a central role; and new labor market theories, including efficiency wages and insider-outsider models. These building blocks should help to explain how price flexibility contributes to macroeconomic fluctuations and to unemployment. In particular, the first two building blocks will explain why small shocks to the economy can give rise to large changes in output, while the new labor market theories will explain why those changes in output (with their associated changes in the demand curve for labor) result in unemployment.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "the purpos of thi paper is to describ one strand of new keynesian literatur which explor how increas flexibl of wage and price might exacerb the economi downturn and to contrast it with other strand of new keynesian literatur thi strand of literatur hold that even if wage and price were perfectli flexibl output and employ would be highli volatil it see the economi as amplifi the shock that it experi and make their effect persist it identifi incomplet contract and in particular imperfect index as central market failur and it attempt both to explain the caus and consequ of these market failur the model describ here contain three basic ingredi riskavers firm a credit alloc mechan in which creditr riskavers bank play a central role and new labor market theori includ effici wage and insideroutsid model these build block should help to explain how price flexibl contribut to macroeconom fluctuat and to unemploy in particular the first two build block will explain whi small shock to the economi can give rise to larg chang in output while the new labor market theori will explain whi those chang in output with their associ chang in the demand curv for labor result in unemploy", "title": "New and Old Keynesians"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/evoice/v3y2006i6n2.html": {"abstract": "Transfers and economic costs are indeed different in the war in Iraq, and transfers may be significant.", "authors": ["epst33"], "abstractStem": "transfer and econom cost are inde differ in the war in iraq and transfer may be signific", "title": "Reply: Transfers vs. Economic Costs in the Iraq War"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v93y2009i1-2p142-159.html": {"abstract": "We analyze the effects of changes in dividend tax policy using a life-cycle model of the firm, in which new firms first access equity markets, then grow internally, and finally pay dividends when they have reached steady state. We find that unanticipated permanent changes in tax rates have only small effects on aggregate investment, since macroeconomic dynamics are dominated by mature firms for which dividend taxation is not distortionary. Anticipated or temporary dividend tax changes, on the other hand, create incentives for firms to engage in inter-temporal tax arbitrage so as to reduce investors' tax burden. For example, a temporary tax cut - the type most likely to be enacted by policymakers - induces firms to accelerate dividend payments while tax rates are low, which reduces their cash holdings and makes them capital-constrained when large investment opportunities arise. This can significantly lower aggregate investment for periods after the tax cut.", "authors": ["epko142", "epst33"], "abstractStem": "we analyz the effect of chang in dividend tax polici use a lifecycl model of the firm in which new firm first access equiti market then grow intern and final pay dividend when they have reach steadi state we find that unanticip perman chang in tax rate have onli small effect on aggreg invest sinc macroeconom dynam are domin by matur firm for which dividend taxat is not distortionari anticip or temporari dividend tax chang on the other hand creat incent for firm to engag in intertempor tax arbitrag so as to reduc investor tax burden for exampl a temporari tax cut  the type most like to be enact by policymak  induc firm to acceler dividend payment while tax rate are low which reduc their cash hold and make them capitalconstrain when larg invest opportun aris thi can significantli lower aggreg invest for period after the tax cut", "title": "Dividend taxation and intertemporal tax arbitrage"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedfpr/y1989x3.html": {"abstract": "This paper presents a simple, general equilibrium macroeconomic model incorporating financial constraints, both credit and equity rationing, as well as other informational imperfections in labor and product markets, such as efficiency wage effects.
