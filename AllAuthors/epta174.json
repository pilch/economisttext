Because this balanced international picture has largely disappeared, the 1980s view about monetary policy coordination needs to be reexamined. The source of the problem is not that the models or the theory are wrong. Rather there was a deviation from the rule-like monetary policies that worked well in the 1980s and 1990s, and this deviation helped break down the international monetary balance. There were similar deviations at many central banks, an apparent spillover culminating in a global great deviation.

The paper argues that both these views are misleading. It advances a new view of the role of expectations that is still emerging from current macroeconomic reearch. The new view recognizes the importance of contractual arrangements which prevent a modern economy from adjusting instantaneously to policy changes, even if they are expected.

It examines historical changes in (1) macroeconomic performance, (2) the adherence to rules-based monetary policy, and (3) the degree of central bank independence. Macroeconomic performance is defined in terms of both price stability and output stability. Both de jure and de facto central bank independence at the Federal Reserve are considered. The main finding is that changes in macroeconomic performance during the past half century were closely associated with changes in the adherence to rules-based monetary policy and in the degree of de facto monetary independence at the Federal Reserve. But changes in economic performance were not associated with changes in de jure central bank independence. Formal central bank independence alone has not generated good monetary policy outcomes.

A quantitative model of overlapping con- tracts explicitly oriented toward the major union sector is developed. The model takes account of expectations of future wage, price, and employment conditions as in more aggregated models that have been used in macroeconomic research. In addition, the distribution of workers according to contract length as well as deferred wage increases and escalator clauses are explicitly used in the model. The main aim of the model is to determine the constraints which these contracts impose on disinflation paths. The model indicates that the maximum speed of disinflation is extremely slow in the early phases -- if a rise in unemployment is to be avoided -- but increases considerably before the new lower rate of inflation is reached. The disinflation path is considerably slower than that observed after hyperinflation periods. However, the existence of a path of inflation reduction raises questions about whether the institution of union wage con- tracts is really the direct cause of costly disinflations, or whether their influence works indirectly by raising credibility problems about a monetary disinflation.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epta174"], "abstractStem": "thi paper examin the role of union wage contract in the persist of inflat and the implic of these contract for the problem of disinfl in the unit state a quantit model of overlap con tract explicitli orient toward the major union sector is develop the model take account of expect of futur wage price and employ condit as in more aggreg model that have been use in macroeconom research in addit the distribut of worker accord to contract length as well as defer wage increas and escal claus are explicitli use in the model the main aim of the model is to determin the constraint which these contract impos on disinfl path the model indic that the maximum speed of disinfl is extrem slow in the earli phase  if a rise in unemploy is to be avoid  but increas consider befor the new lower rate of inflat is reach the disinfl path is consider slower than that observ after hyperinfl period howev the exist of a path of inflat reduct rais question about whether the institut of union wage con tract is realli the direct caus of costli disinfl or whether their influenc work indirectli by rais credibl problem about a monetari disinflationpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Union Wage Settlements during a Disinflation"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v12y1983i1p123-125.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epta174"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "`Rules, discretion and reputation in a model of monetary policy' by Robert J.
