Relative to the existing literature (Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996)), we introduce two main innovations: (i) We derive our tests in an environment where the finite sample properties of the estimators on which the forecasts may depend are preserved asymptotically. (ii) We accommodate conditional evaluation objectives (can we predict which forecast will be more accurate at a future date?), which nest unconditional objectives (which forecast was more accurate on average?), that have been the sole focus of previous literature. As a result of (i), our tests have several advantages: they capture the effect of estimation uncertainty on relative forecast performance, they can handle forecasts based on both nested and nonnested models, they allow the forecasts to be produced by general estimation methods, and they are easy to compute. Although both unconditional and conditional approaches are informative, conditioning can help fine-tune the forecast selection to current economic conditions. To this end, we propose a two-step decision rule that uses current information to select the best forecast for the future date of interest.

We extend the basic framework to include time trends and dynamics in the explanatory variables, and we show how distributional effects as well as average partial effects are identified. Our approach also allows endogeneity in the transitory unobservables.

Policy effectiveness is ensured by another explicit causality condition. These properties only involve the data generating process; models play a subsidiary role. Our framework thus complements that of Ericsson et al. (1998) (EHM) by providing conditions for policy analysis alternative to weak, strong, and superexogeneity. This makes possible policy analysis for systems that may fail EHM\u2019s conditions. It also facilitates analysis of the cointegrating properties of systems subject to policymaker control.

This paper provides a nonparametric test for separability in structural equations. The test is based on a conditional independence test recently developed by Huang et al. (2013), building on consistent procedures of Bierens (1982, 1990) and Stinchcombe and White (1998). The test is easy to implement and achieves n local power. We apply our test to study interest rate elasticities of loan demand in microfinance and the impact of education on wages.", "authors": ["epwh17"], "abstractStem": "separ is an import featur of structur equat as it impli the absenc of unobserv heterogen of effect and ha signific implic for identif and effici of estim thi paper provid a nonparametr test for separ in structur equat the test is base on a condit independ test recent develop by huang et al 2013 build on consist procedur of bieren 1982 1990 and stinchcomb and white 1998 the test is easi to implement and achiev n local power we appli our test to studi interest rate elast of loan demand in microfin and the impact of educ on wage", "title": "Testing for separability in structural equations"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/econom/v19y1982i2-3p301-318.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epwh17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Regularity conditions for cox's test of non-nested hypotheses"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/econom/v120y2004i2p295-326.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha13", "epwh17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Subsampling the distribution of diverging statistics with applications to finance"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/econom/v141y2007i2p807-834.html": {"abstract": "This paper proposes a nonparametric test of conditional independence based on the notion that two conditional distributions are equal if and only if the corresponding conditional characteristic functions are equal. We use the functional delta method to expand the test statistic around the population truth and establish asymptotic normality under $\\beta -$mixing conditions. We show that the test is consistent and has power against local alternatives at distance $n^{-1/2}h_{1}^{-(d_{1}+d_{3})/4}.$ The cases for which not all random variables of interest are\\ continuously valued or observable are also treated, and we show that the test is nuisance-parameter free. Simulation results suggest that the test has better finite sample performance than the Hellinger metric test of Su and White (2002) in detecting nonlinear Granger causality in the mean. Applications to exchange rates and to stock prices and trading volumes indicate that our test can reveal some interesting nonlinear causal relations that the traditional linear Granger causality test fails to detect.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpsu241", "epwh17"], "abstractStem": "thi paper propos a nonparametr test of condit independ base on the notion that two condit distribut are equal if and onli if the correspond condit characterist function are equal we use the function delta method to expand the test statist around the popul truth and establish asymptot normal under beta mix condit we show that the test is consist and ha power against local altern at distanc n12h1d1d34 the case for which not all random variabl of interest are continu valu or observ are also treat and we show that the test is nuisanceparamet free simul result suggest that the test ha better finit sampl perform than the helling metric test of su and white 2002 in detect nonlinear granger causal in the mean applic to exchang rate and to stock price and trade volum indic that our test can reveal some interest nonlinear causal relat that the tradit linear granger causal test fail to detectpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "A consistent characteristic function-based test for conditional independence"}, "firstname": "Halbert", "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v87y1979i3p522-39.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epwh17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Optimal Investment in Schooling when Incomes are Risky"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/econom/v187y2015i1p169-188.html": {"abstract": "This paper proposes methods for estimation and inference in multivariate, multi-quantile models. The theory can simultaneously accommodate models with multiple random variables, multiple confidence levels, and multiple lags of the associated quantiles.

We estimate a simple version of the model using market equity returns data to analyze spillovers in the values at risk (VaR) between a market index and financial institutions. We construct impulse-response functions for the quantiles of a sample of 230 financial institutions around the world and study how financial institution-specific and system-wide shocks are absorbed by the system.
