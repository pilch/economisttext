Our starting point is the observation that a well-behaved social welfare function need not evaluate global' (vertical equity) differences in after-tax income using the same weights it applies to local' (horizontal equity) differences, even though this constraint has been applied in the past. Following work on the structure of individual preferences, we show that a social welfare function can imply different preferences toward horizontal and vertical equity. Adopting the general approach to the measurement of inequality developed by Atkinson (1970), we use such a social welfare function to derive measures of inequality that are decomposable into components naturally interpreted as indices of horizontal and vertical equity. In particular, the former index measures deviations from the fundamental principle that equals be treated equally. Finally, we apply our new measure to two tax-return data sets, evaluating the degree to which the horizontal equity of the US personal income tax has changed over time, and how horizontal equity would be altered by one version of recent proposals to do away with the so-called marriage penalty.'<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epau33", "fpha378"], "abstractStem": "in thi paper we propos a new measur of horizont equiti that overcom mani of the shortcom of previou propos measur our start point is the observ that a wellbehav social welfar function need not evalu global vertic equiti differ in aftertax incom use the same weight it appli to local horizont equiti differ even though thi constraint ha been appli in the past follow work on the structur of individu prefer we show that a social welfar function can impli differ prefer toward horizont and vertic equiti adopt the gener approach to the measur of inequ develop by atkinson 1970 we use such a social welfar function to deriv measur of inequ that are decompos into compon natur interpret as indic of horizont and vertic equiti in particular the former index measur deviat from the fundament principl that equal be treat equal final we appli our new measur to two taxreturn data set evalu the degre to which the horizont equiti of the us person incom tax ha chang over time and how horizont equiti would be alter by one version of recent propos to do away with the socal marriag penaltypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "A New Measure of Horizontal Equity"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedcec/y1998ijan15.html": {"abstract": "A look at how some basic tax reform proposals stack up against four, sometimes competing, requirements laid out by President Clinton in a December 1997 speech: Is the proposal fiscally responsible?

There has been less focus on EGTRRA\u2019s incentive effects; one of the most important potential behavioral effects is on saving. To analyze the behavioral effects of the Bush tax cut on saving and other macroeconomic variables, I use the Auerbach-Kotlikoff (1987) model in conjunction with the NBER\u2019s TAXSIM model. An interesting by-product of this analysis is the \"dynamic scoring\" of the tax cut--the estimated feedback effects of behavior on revenue. By comparing the revenue losses generated by the model with those that would occur without any behavioral response, one can estimate how much of the static revenue loss would be recouped by expanded economic activity.
