Historically, large-scale violence has impacted cities in three ways. First, concentrations of people have an advantage in defending themselves from attackers, making cities more appealing in times of violence. Second, cities often make attractive targets for violence, which creates an incentive for people to disperse. Finally, since warfare and terrorism often specifically target means of transportation, violence can increase the effective cost of transportation, which will usually increase the demand for density. Evidence on war and cities in the 20th century suggests that the effect of wars on urban form can be large (for example, Berlin in World War II), but more commonly neither terrorism nor wars have significantly altered urban form. As such, across America the effect of terrorism on cities is likely to be small. The only exception to this is downtown New York which, absent large-scale subsidies, will probably not be fully rebuilt.

The authors contend that the future scope of city-based redistributive policies is limited. An important way in which policymakers work to reduce inequality is by redistributing income from the wealthy to the poor, channeling income tax revenue into spending on welfare and other services. The authors suggest, however, that New York City and other cities have had to scale back their redistributive policies. New York City's evolution from a manufacturing city to a service city accounts for more than one-third of the reduction in redistribution, because businesses in the service sector are more mobile and are therefore harder to tax than those in manufacturing. In addition, the authors document a more general decline in the relationship between land area and redistribution. In 1970, cities with greater land area tended to redistribute more income, but by 1990, this connection was no longer evident.

First, the existence of a spatial equilibrium suggests that utility levels will be equalized across space, so there is little equity rationale for indexing transfers to local prices. Second, since transfers to high cost areas buy less than transfers to low cost areas, it is in fact less efficient to transfer to high cost areas. However, even though migration ensures that utilities are equalized across space, marginal utilities of income will not necessarily be equalized, and since optimal transfer policy equalizes marginal,not total, utilities there is possibly a rationale for indexing to local pricelevels. Optimal indexing is a function of the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the elasticity of migration with respect to transfer differences across space and the degree to which higher amenities in high cost areas increase or decrease the marginal utility of income. Given my best parameter estimates, a one percent increase in local prices should lead to a .5 percent increase in transfers, when transfers are 2/3 of total income.

We assume that these shocks are not otherwise insurable because of problems related to asymmetric information or the difficulties inherent in writing complex contracts. The model predicts that interest rate restriction will be tighter when income inequality is high (and impermanent) and when growth rates are low. Data from U.S. states' regulations supports a connection between inequality and usury laws. The history of usury laws suggests that this social insurance mechanism is one reason why usury laws persist, but it also suggests that usury laws have had different functions across time (eg. rent-seeking, limiting agency problems within the church, limiting overcommitment of debts, and attacking commerce generally).<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epgl9", "epsc26"], "abstractStem": "interest rate restrict are among the most pervas form of econom regul thi paper explain that these restrict can be explain as a mean of primit social insur interest rate limit are pareto improv becaus agent borrow when they have temporari neg incom shock  interest rate restrict transfer wealth to agent who have receiv those neg shock and whose margin util of incom is high we assum that these shock are not otherwis insur becaus of problem relat to asymmetr inform or the difficulti inher in write complex contract the model predict that interest rate restrict will be tighter when incom inequ is high and imperman and when growth rate are low data from us state regul support a connect between inequ and usuri law the histori of usuri law suggest that thi social insur mechan is one reason whi usuri law persist but it also suggest that usuri law have had differ function across time eg rentseek limit agenc problem within the church limit overcommit of debt and attack commerc generallypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Neither a Borrower nor a Lender Be: An Economic Analysis of Interest Restrictions and Usury Laws"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v41y2003i2p401-425.html": {"abstract": "The Progressive Era of the early twentieth-century U.S. saw significant growth of government regulation of business.
