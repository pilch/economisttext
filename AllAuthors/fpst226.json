It is shown that the model is compatible with some important features of the real-world behavior of exchange rates. When households are imperfectly informed about the distribution of money growth, the exchange rate exhibits patterns of overshooting and is more volatile than the ratio of the money stocks.

We hypothesize that controlling shareholders of firms listed in the U.S. cannot extract as many private benefits from control compared to controlling shareholders of firms not listed in the U.S., but that their firms are better able to take advantage of growth opportunities. Consequently, the cross-listed firms should be those firms where the interests of the controlling shareholder are better aligned with the interests of other shareholders. The growth opportunities of cross-listed firms will be more highly valued than those of firms not listed in the U.S. both because cross-listed firms are better able to take advantage of these opportunities and because a smaller fraction of the cash flow of these firms is expropriated by controlling shareholders.

The model focuses on an entrepreneur who needs to raise funds to finance the firm's investment opportunities and who decides whether or not to invest in better firm-level governance mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We show that, for a given level of country investor protection, the incentives to adopt better governance mechanisms at the firm level increase with a country's financial and economic development. When economic and financial development is poor, the incentives to improve firm-level governance are low because outside finance is expensive and the adoption of better governance mechanisms is expensive. Using firm-level data on international corporate governance and transparency ratings for a large sample of firms from around the world, we find evidence consistent with this prediction. Specifically, we show that (1) almost all of the variation in governance ratings across firms in less developed countries is attributable to country characteristics rather than firm characteristics typically used to explain governance choices, (2) firm characteristics explain more of the variation in governance ratings in more developed countries, and (3) access to global capital markets sharpens firm incentives for better governance, but decreases the importance of home-country legal protections of minority investors.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpka329", "fpst226"], "abstractStem": "thi paper develop and test a model of how countri characterist such as legal protect for minor investor and the level of econom and financi develop influenc firm cost and benefit in implement measur to improv their own govern and transpar the model focus on an entrepreneur who need to rais fund to financ the firm invest opportun and who decid whether or not to invest in better firmlevel govern mechan to reduc agenc cost we show that for a given level of countri investor protect the incent to adopt better govern mechan at the firm level increas with a countri financi and econom develop when econom and financi develop is poor the incent to improv firmlevel govern are low becaus outsid financ is expens and the adopt of better govern mechan is expens use firmlevel data on intern corpor govern and transpar rate for a larg sampl of firm from around the world we find evid consist with thi predict specif we show that 1 almost all of the variat in govern rate across firm in less develop countri is attribut to countri characterist rather than firm characterist typic use to explain govern choic 2 firm characterist explain more of the variat in govern rate in more develop countri and 3 access to global capit market sharpen firm incent for better govern but decreas the import of homecountri legal protect of minor investorspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Why do countries matter so much for corporate governance?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v54y1999i2p227-264.html": {"abstract": "This paper examines the impact of foreign investors on stock returns in Korea from November 30, 1996, to the end of 1997 using trade data.
