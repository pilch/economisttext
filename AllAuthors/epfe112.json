In contrast, the present paper focuses on the way that pensions are likely to evolve in response to the expectation of continued inflation in the future and to the uncertainty about the rate of inflation. The unfortunate effects that occurred when inflation caught pensioners and pension fund managers by surprise should not be confused with an inability to adjust to future conditions, even uncertain future conditions. As I shall explain, the persistence of a high rate of inflation is likely to increase the share of total saving that goes into private pensions. Since the tax treatment of pension contributions allows individuals to save in this way for retirement on the same terms that they would under a consumption tax,' the existence of the private pension system may be one of a few things that prevents the national saving rate from going even lower in the current inflationary environment.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "much of the recent discuss about the relat between pension and inflat ha emphas the advers impact that the unexpect rise in inflat ha had on pension recipi and on the perform of pension fund in contrast the present paper focus on the way that pension are like to evolv in respons to the expect of continu inflat in the futur and to the uncertainti about the rate of inflat the unfortun effect that occur when inflat caught pension and pension fund manag by surpris should not be confus with an inabl to adjust to futur condit even uncertain futur condit as i shall explain the persist of a high rate of inflat is like to increas the share of total save that goe into privat pension sinc the tax treatment of pension contribut allow individu to save in thi way for retir on the same term that they would under a consumpt tax the exist of the privat pension system may be one of a few thing that prevent the nation save rate from go even lower in the current inflationari environmentpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Private Pensions and Inflation"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v76y1986i2p26-30.html": {"abstract": "This paper, prepared for the annual meetings of the American Economic Association, examines the claims that were made at the beginning of the decade by the \"new\" supply-siders and contrasts their views with the traditional supply-side economics that has been a prominent part of economics since Adam Smith.

The official projections that these costs will rise rapidly from 2.5% of GDP now to 5.5% of GDP in 2030 and 7% of GDP in 2070 assume that structural changes in health care will prevent the even more rapid growth of spending that would occur if past trends continue. These GDP shares are equivalent to increasing the payroll tax rates that rise from 5% of total wages now to 14% of total wages by 2070. Alternatively, if the increased Medicare spending is financed by an across-the-board increase in income tax rates, all tax rates would rise by 46 percent (e.g., from 28% to 41%). If Medicare costs continue to be tax financed, the sharp increase in Medicare costs would cause a substantial increase in the deadweight loss of the tax system. Even with quite favorable assumptions, the increased deadweight loss is likely to be almost as large as the direct increase in the health care costs themselves. This paper analyzes an alternative life cycle approach to paying for the cost of health care of the aged: a system of investment-based individual Retiree Health Accounts (RHAs) to which the government deposits funds during individuals' working years. At retirement the individual could use the accumulated fund to purchase a fee-for-service plan like the current Medicare package, to pay for membership in an HMO, or to establish a medical savings account with a high deductible insurance policy. Using data from the Social Security administration, I estimate that annual RHA deposits equal to about 1.4% of total payroll would eventually be enough to pay for the full increase in the cost of Medicare, obviating a nine percentage point payroll tax increase.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "the medicar program of health care for the age now cost more than 5000 per enrolle a nation cost of more than 200 billion a year the offici project that these cost will rise rapidli from 25 of gdp now to 55 of gdp in 2030 and 7 of gdp in 2070 assum that structur chang in health care will prevent the even more rapid growth of spend that would occur if past trend continu these gdp share are equival to increas the payrol tax rate that rise from 5 of total wage now to 14 of total wage by 2070 altern if the increas medicar spend is financ by an acrosstheboard increas in incom tax rate all tax rate would rise by 46 percent eg from 28 to 41 if medicar cost continu to be tax financ the sharp increas in medicar cost would caus a substanti increas in the deadweight loss of the tax system even with quit favor assumpt the increas deadweight loss is like to be almost as larg as the direct increas in the health care cost themselv thi paper analyz an altern life cycl approach to pay for the cost of health care of the age a system of investmentbas individu retire health account rha to which the govern deposit fund dure individu work year at retir the individu could use the accumul fund to purchas a feeforservic plan like the current medicar packag to pay for membership in an hmo or to establish a medic save account with a high deduct insur polici use data from the social secur administr i estim that annual rha deposit equal to about 14 of total payrol would eventu be enough to pay for the full increas in the cost of medicar obviat a nine percentag point payrol tax increasepthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Prefunding Medicare"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v66y1976i5p809-20.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Inflation, Income Taxes, and the Rate of Interest: A Theoretical Analysis"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/evoice/v3y2006i6n5.html": {"abstract": "Although rates are lower than in the past, the combination of the corporate and personal tax rates still imply high marginal tax rates on capital income.

Thus, states cannot redistribute income for a period of even a few years. The adjustment of gross wages to tax rates implies that a more progressive tax system raises the cost to firms of hiring more highly skilled employees and reduces the cost of lower skilled labor. A more progressive tax thus induces firms to hire fewer high skilled employees and to hire more low skilled employees. Since state taxes cannot alter net wages, there can be no trade- off at the state level between distribution goals and economic efficiency.

The social security payroll tax distorts labor supply and the form in which compensation is paid. Although each individual's benefits are linked to that individual's previous payroll tax payments, the low equilibrium rate of return inherent in an unfunded system implies a `net' payroll tax that causes distortions. The resulting deadweight loss is 1% of each year's GDP in perpetuity, an amount equal to 20% of payroll tax revenue and a 50% increase in deadweight loss of the personal income tax. Also, there is the loss of investment income resulting from forcing employees to accept the low implicit return of an unfunded program rather than the much higher return paid on private saving or in a funded social security program. The present value of the annual losses from using an unfunded system exceeds the benefit to those who received windfall transfers when the program began and when it expanded. Shifting to a funded program cannot reverse the crowding out of capital that has already occurred. Recognizing the existing unfunded obligation only makes that piece of the national debt explicit, but shifting to a funded program limits crowding out of capital formation to the amount that already occurred. Future increases in annual saving that result from economic growth are able to earn the higher rate of return on real capital. The present value of these gains is equivalent to a perpetuity of more than 2% of GDP a year.

Previous analyses have underestimated the cost of a permanent increase in the inflation rate because they have ignored the growth of the economy and therefore the growth of the future instantaneous welfare costs. In the important case in which the growth of aggregate income exceeds the social discount rate, no reduction in unemployment can justify any permanent increase in the rate of inflation.

This conclusion has motivated extensive empirical analysis of the tax rates on different types of capital income. It has also been the basis for a variety of proposals to revise actual tax rules.The present paper emphasizes that the comventional view must be modified in the very common situation in which some capital tax rate is politically constrained to something other than its optimal value, e.g., the zero rates on the imputed income on owner-occupied housing. The formal analysis of the paper examines the case in which there are three types of capital income and one of the tax rates is arbitrarily constrained to be zero.Three general \"rule of thumb\" results emerge from the specific analysis: First, if the several types of capital can be regarded as independent in production, the optimal tax rates on the taxable types of capital income should depart from equality in the direction of an inverse elasticity rule. Second, in comparison to these rates, capital that is a complement to the untaxed capital should generally be taxed more heavily while capital that is a substitute for the untaxed capital should be taxed less heavily. Third, variations in the degree of complementarity or substitutability between the two types of capital should alter the two tax rates in a way that maintains a constant difference in the total taxes on each type of capital. Although these rule-of-thumb results help to modify the conventional equal-tax-rates rule in an appropriate way, the most important implication of the present analysis is that any departure from optimal taxation makes it very difficult to set other capital tax rates optimally.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "an import proposit in the theori of effici taxat is that if capit incom is tax all type of capit incom should be tax at the same rate thi conclus ha motiv extens empir analysi of the tax rate on differ type of capit incom it ha also been the basi for a varieti of propos to revis actual tax rulesth present paper emphas that the comvent view must be modifi in the veri common situat in which some capit tax rate is polit constrain to someth other than it optim valu eg the zero rate on the imput incom on owneroccupi hous the formal analysi of the paper examin the case in which there are three type of capit incom and one of the tax rate is arbitrarili constrain to be zerothre gener rule of thumb result emerg from the specif analysi first if the sever type of capit can be regard as independ in product the optim tax rate on the taxabl type of capit incom should depart from equal in the direct of an invers elast rule second in comparison to these rate capit that is a complement to the untax capit should gener be tax more heavili while capit that is a substitut for the untax capit should be tax less heavili third variat in the degre of complementar or substitut between the two type of capit should alter the two tax rate in a way that maintain a constant differ in the total tax on each type of capit although these ruleofthumb result help to modifi the convent equaltaxr rule in an appropri way the most import implic of the present analysi is that ani departur from optim taxat make it veri difficult to set other capit tax rate optimallypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "The Second Best Theory of Differential Capital Taxation"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v41y1990i1p31-43.html": {"abstract": "The social security program now provides a constant real benefit throughout each retirees lifetime. This paper examines whether total welfare would rise if benefits were lower in early retirement years (when most individuals have some saving with which to finance consumption) and higher in later years (when the uncertainty of survival and the absence of actuarially fair private annuities makes the availability of social security benefits more important.) The analysis shows that there is a potentially important difference between the structure of benefits that would be preferred by the current population of workers and retirees and the structure of benefits that would maximize the steady state level of social welfare. This difference reflects the role of unintended bequests. The provision of higher benefits to older retirees reduces individually optimal savings and therefore the level of unintended bequests. While those bequests may have no value to the retirees, they are clearly of value to the young workers who will receive those bequests. More generally, the system of level benefits raises the steady state level of the capital stock and of total real income.

In the case of a temporary increase in government spending, it has been argued that debt finance is optimal because the small increments in all future tax rates to finance interest payments involves a smaller excess burden than the single large tax rate increase that would be required to avoid an initial increase in the national debt. This argument ignores the excess burden of debt finance that results if the initial capital stock is smaller than optimal (e.g., because of taxes or capital income).The first section of the present paper shows how the debt-finance advantage of a small increase in tax rates can be explicitly balanced against the disadvantage of the excess burden that arises from additional debt. The analysis shows that, with plausible parameter values, the excess burden of debt finance is likely to outweigh the advantage of avoiding a large single tax change and therefore that financing a temporary increase in government spending by an immediate tax increase is likely to be preferable to debt financing.The second section examines the appropriate response to a permanent increase in government spending and shows that such spending cannot be financed by a permanent increase in government debt. Moreover, whenever the golden rule level of capital intensity is an optimality condition independent of the level of government spending, any increase in government spending should be matched by an equal increase in tax revenue.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "if a specifi amount of govern spend must be financ how should that financ be divid between tax and govern borrow in the case of a temporari increas in govern spend it ha been argu that debt financ is optim becaus the small increment in all futur tax rate to financ interest payment involv a smaller excess burden than the singl larg tax rate increas that would be requir to avoid an initi increas in the nation debt thi argument ignor the excess burden of debt financ that result if the initi capit stock is smaller than optim eg becaus of tax or capit incometh first section of the present paper show how the debtfin advantag of a small increas in tax rate can be explicitli balanc against the disadvantag of the excess burden that aris from addit debt the analysi show that with plausibl paramet valu the excess burden of debt financ is like to outweigh the advantag of avoid a larg singl tax chang and therefor that financ a temporari increas in govern spend by an immedi tax increas is like to be prefer to debt financingth second section examin the appropri respons to a perman increas in govern spend and show that such spend cannot be financ by a perman increas in govern debt moreov whenev the golden rule level of capit intens is an optim condit independ of the level of govern spend ani increas in govern spend should be match by an equal increas in tax revenuepthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Debt and taxes in the theory of public finance"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedkpr/y1999p369-378.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Commentary : avoiding currency crises"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v2y1973i2p159-171.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Tax incentives, corporate saving, and capital accumulation in the United States"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jpolmo/v22y2000i3p345-354.html": {"abstract": "The creation of the euro and the European Central Bank is a remarkable and unprecedented event in economic and political history: creating a supranational central bank and leaving eleven countries without national currencies of their own.

The analysis uses the information on inflation-adjusted income and assets that large firms were required to provide for 1976 and subsequent years. The evidence for a sample of nearly 200 manufacturing firms is consistent with the conclusion that share prices fully reflect the value of unfunded pension obligations. Since the conventional accounting measure of the unfunded pension liability has a number of problems (which we examine in the paper), it would be more accurate to say that the data are consistent with the conclusion that shareholders accept the conventional measure as the best available information and reduce share prices by a corresponding amount. The most important implication of the share price response is that the existence of unfunded private pension liabilities does not necessarily entail a reduction in total private saving. Because the pension liability reduces the equity value of the firm, shareholders are given notice of its existence and an incentive to save more themselves.

In this model, I show that, with current U.S. tax laws, an increase in the rate of inflation reduces the equilibrium amount of business capital employed in the economy and raises the amount of housing capital. The analysis also shows that a higher rate of inflation lowers the real net-of-tax rate of return to the provider of business capital. In a richer model than the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate of personal saving was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a higher inflation rate would therefore lower the rate of saving.

The paper begins by examining how capital income taxes reduce the real return to savers and then discusses the welfare loss of capital income taxation relative to the alternatives of taxing consumption and labor income.The second part deals with social security retirement benefits. In 1994, older Americans will receive cash and medical benefits that cost the government $530 billion or $16,000 per person over 65. A final section discusses the implications of international capital flows for this analysis. As capital flows become more important, the response of government policy may be to compete for foreign capital inflows and to tax domestic savers more heavily; leading to a smaller total volume of capital. The sharp decline in the net national saving rate-from over 8% of GDP in the U.S. in the 1970s to only 4.5% in the 1980s &amp; from over 14% of GDP in Europe in the 1970s to 9.9% in the 1980s -- may not only create lower real incomes and slower growth but may weaken capitalism itself. In the US a decade of slow growth has increased protectionist tendencies in international trade and led to a new interest in industrial policies that expand the role of the government in guiding the direction of technology of private investment.

The majorityof unemployedindividuals report reservation wages that are at least as highas the wage they were paid on their last job. Approximately one-fourth of alljob seekers required a wage that is at least 10 percent higher than the wage ontheir previous job.Our econometric evidence shows that the level of unemployment benefitsrelative to previous wages has a powerful effect on the individual's reservation wage. A ten percent increase in the U.I. replacement ratio increases the reservation wage by about percent for job losers who are not on layoff and bysomewhat less for other unemployed groups. Separate regressions to analyze the high reservation wage per se show that a ten percent increase in the U.I. replacement ratio also increases by about four percentage points the probability that an unemployed individual will require a wage increase of 10 percent or more.These estimates imply that reducing net unemployment insurance benefits (by lowering gross benefits or by taxing unemployment benefits) could significantly lower the average duration of unemployment and the relative number of long duration spells of unemployment.

We focus on the risk after the plan is fully phased in. Individuals deposit a fraction of wages to a Personal Retirement Account (PRA), invest these funds in a 60:40 equity-debt mix, and in a similarly invested annuity at age 67. The value of the assets follows a random walk with mean and variance of a 60:40 equity-debt portfolio over the period 1946-95, a mean log return of 5.5 percent (net of administrative costs of 0.4 percent) and a standard deviation of 12.5 percent. We study he stochastic distributions of this process by doing 10,000 simulations of the 80-year experience of the cohort that reached age 21 in 1998. The resulting annuities are compared to the future defined benefits specified in current law (the benchmark' benefits). With no uncertainty, a 5.5 percent log return would permit the benchmark benefits to be purchased with PRA deposits of 3.1 percent of payroll, only one-sixth of the pay-as-you-go tax needed for the benchmark benefits. Saving a higher share of wages provides a cushion' that protects the individual from the risk of an unacceptably low level of benefits. For example, PRA deposits of 6 percent of wages reduces the probability that the benefits are less than the benchmark to 0.17 and the probability that they are less than 61 percent of the benchmark to 0.05. PRA deposits of 9 percent of wages (half of the tax rate required in a pay-as-you-go system) would substantially reduce these risks. This pure investment-based plan is an extreme case. The investment risk can be reduced further by using a mixed system that combines pay-as-you-go and investment-based components or that makes intergenerational transfers conditional on the performance of stock and bond prices.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "thi paper examin the risk aspect of an investmentbas defin contribut social secur plan we focu on the risk after the plan is fulli phase in individu deposit a fraction of wage to a person retir account pra invest these fund in a 6040 equitydebt mix and in a similarli invest annuiti at age 67 the valu of the asset follow a random walk with mean and varianc of a 6040 equitydebt portfolio over the period 194695 a mean log return of 55 percent net of administr cost of 04 percent and a standard deviat of 125 percent we studi he stochast distribut of thi process by do 10000 simul of the 80year experi of the cohort that reach age 21 in 1998 the result annuiti are compar to the futur defin benefit specifi in current law the benchmark benefit with no uncertainti a 55 percent log return would permit the benchmark benefit to be purchas with pra deposit of 31 percent of payrol onli onesixth of the payasyougo tax need for the benchmark benefit save a higher share of wage provid a cushion that protect the individu from the risk of an unaccept low level of benefit for exampl pra deposit of 6 percent of wage reduc the probabl that the benefit are less than the benchmark to 017 and the probabl that they are less than 61 percent of the benchmark to 005 pra deposit of 9 percent of wage half of the tax rate requir in a payasyougo system would substanti reduc these risk thi pure investmentbas plan is an extrem case the invest risk can be reduc further by use a mix system that combin payasyougo and investmentbas compon or that make intergener transfer condit on the perform of stock and bond pricespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Individual Risk in an Investment-Based Social Security System"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v52y1997i3p1182-84.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": " Public Policy and Financial Markets: Privatizing Social Security"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v6y1976i1-2p77-104.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "On the theory of tax reform"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jfsres/v18y2000i2p115-117.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Anna Schwartz at the National Bureau of Economic Research"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/ecinqu/v21y1983i1p11-23.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The Fiscal Framework of Monetary Economics"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v80y1990i3p589-99.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epel79", "epfe112"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Government Debt, Government Spending, and Private Sector Behavior Revisited: Comment"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v68y1978i2p155-58.html": {"abstract": "This short note emphasizes and illustrates two basic points: (1) The private costs of unemployment, i.e., the costs borne by the unemployed themselves, vary substantially and are often extremely low.

U.S. productivity growth accelerated while that in Europe declined. This paper asks why U.S. productivity growth has been faster than in the past and than in Europe. An important reason for the faster growth has been the strong incentives for managers at all levels to make the kinds of changes that can raise productivity even if that involves personal risk and discomfort. These incentives became much stronger during the 1990s for reasons that I speculate about but do not begin to understand fully. The information technology developments in personal computers and in internet and intranet communications provided a powerful means to achieve the productivity gains that everyone was seeking. But even if the new IT opportunities had not come along, the combination of strong incentives and a receptive corporate climate would have led managers to find other ways to increase productivity, although undoubtedly not by as much. European firms had neither the incentive structure nor the corporate environment supportive of making change that could involve significant job changes and layoffs. Although Europe has higher unemployment rates, it is much more difficult to lay off workers in Europe than in the United States. Reorganizing white collar work to change job assignments and locations is also much easier in the U.S. than in Europe. The future is likely to see continued strong productivity growth and perhaps even increasing productivity growth in the United States if the incentives and corporate environments remain supportive.

The thrust of the Keynesian prescription was to increase the government deficit to provide demand for the resources that would not otherwise be used for either consumption or investment. In this way, aggregate demand would be maintained by substituting public consumption for private consumption. A second alternative prescription was to reduce the private saving rate. Early Keynesians like Seymour Harris saw the new Social Security program as an effective way to reduce aggregate saving. The third type of policy, developed by JamesTobin, relies on increasing the rate of inflation and making money less attractive relative to real capital. In Tobin's analysis, the resulting increase in capital intensity offsets the higher saving rate and therefore maintains aggregate demand. This paper will examine ways of increasing capital intensity without raising the rate of inflation.

While some observers claim that the U.S. economy can continue to have trade deficits of this magnitude for years -- some would say for decades -- into the future, I believe that such enormous deficits cannot continue and will decline significantly in the coming years. This paper discusses the reasons for that decline and the changes that are needed in the U.S. saving rate and in the value of the dollar to bring it about. Reducing the U.S. current account deficit does not require action by the U.S. government or by the governments of America's trading partners. Market forces alone will cause the U.S. trade deficit to decline further. In practice, however, changes in government policies at home and abroad may lead to faster reductions in the U.S. trade deficit. More important, the response of the U.S. and foreign governments and central banks will determine the way in which the global economy as a whole adjusts to the decline in the U.S. trade deficit. Reductions in the U.S. current account deficit will of course imply lower aggregate trade surpluses in the rest of the world.

The current paper examines the apparent conflict between the potential mobility of capital and the observed de facto segmentation of the global capital market. The key to reconciling this 'Feldstein-Horioka paradox' is that, although capital is free to move, its owners, and especially the agents who are responsible for institutional investments, prefer to keep funds close to home because of a combination of risk aversion, ignorance and a desire to show prudence in their investing behavior. The paper presents evidence on the capital mobility and on capital market segmentation. The role of hedging and the difference between gross and net capital movements for individual investors and borrowers are discussed. The special place of foreign direct investment is also considered.

The strength of the empirical evidence rests on the fact that all three specifications support the same conclusion.

We propose constructing a monetary aggregate so that it is a good leading indicator of nominal GDP; in general the weights on its components vary over time. We investigate two specific procedures: one in which subaggregates discretely switch in and out, and one in which the growth of the aggregate is a time-varying weighted average of the growth of the subaggregates, where the weights follow a random walk. These procedures are used to construct aggregates which potentially augment M2 with stock and/or bond mutual funds.

The basic time series show that both the pretax rate of return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past quarter century. An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for different aspects of the business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and 1.5 percentage points lower in the 1970's than in the 1960's. The rate of profitability in the 1960's was also about one-half of a percentage point greater than the profitability in the 7 years of the 1950's after the Korean war. Changes in productivity growth, in inflation, in relative unit labor costs, and in other variables are all associated with changes in profitability. None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability between the 1950Ts, 1960's and 1970's. Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the pretax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher pretax profits occurring when the tax rate is high.
