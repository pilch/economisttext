By itself, this postulated force will pull producers together, or pull all of them toward a point I designate the center.

The model, based on earlier work by Eaton and Kortum, is built up from the premise that all knowledge resides in the head of some individual person and the knowledge of a firm, or economy, or any group of people is simply the knowledge of the individuals that comprise it. The model is applied to an economy with a cohort structure. A calibration of the model using cross-section earnings data, in addition to aggregate GDP growth, is considered.
