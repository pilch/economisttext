We expand the merchant model to incorporate several attributes of wholesale power markets and transmission networks that the merchant model ignores. These include market power in wholesale electricity markets, lumpiness in transmission investment opportunities, stochastic attributes of transmission networks and associated property rights definition issues, strategic behavior by potential merchant transmission investors and issues related to the coordination of transmission system operators and merchant transmission owners. Incorporating these more realistic attributes of transmission networks and the behavior of transmission owners and system operators leads to the conclusion that several potentially significant inefficiencies may result from reliance on the merchant transmission investment framework.

In a static context, we show that the SSO is an effective certifier if and only if it puts enough weight on users' interests. We then tackle the more challenging problem of SSO certification in a dynamic setting in which new information will accrue in the future and user choices are irreversible. The SSO and the users must then both take a dynamic perspective and contemplate the possibility of a \"second chance\" that may arise for the standard. A key insight is the possibility of multiple self-fulfilling expectations. It is possible to have an equilibrium with no second chance, a lenient SSO endorsement policy and high stigma from early rejection. It is also possible to have an equilibrium with a second chance, a selective SSO endorsement policy and low stigma from early rejection. Finally, and in both the static and the dynamic setups, we ask whether the SSO is too inclined to turn down or to accept the standard from a social viewpoint.

Our theory is based on the idea of self-reputation over one\u2019s willpower, which potentially transforms lapses in a personal rule into precedents that undermine future self-restraint. The foundation for such effects, in turn, is the imperfect recall of past motives and feelings, which leads people to draw inferences from their own past actions. We thus model the behaviour of individuals who are unsure of their willpower (ability to delay ratification) in certain states of the world, and show how self-control can be sustained by the fear of creating damaging precedents. We also show, however, that people will sometimes adopt excessively rigid rules that result in compulsive behaviours such as miserliness, workaholism, or anorexia. These represent costly forms of self-signaling where the individual is so afraid of appearing weak to himself that every decision becomes a test of his willpower, even when self-restraint is not even desirable ex-ante. Such common behaviours which appear to display a \u2018salience of the future\u2019 are thus not only consistent, but actually generated by (a concern over) present-oriented preferences. Finally, we analyse the cognitive underpinnings of self-regulation. We first show how equilibrium behaviour is shaped by the extent to which the individual\u2019s self-monitoring is subject to opportunistic distortions of memory or attribution.

An open access policy raises welfare, but may make the project non-viable since funding must be provided by capital contributions and access charges. The infrastructure owner can ask the incumbent for a higher capital contribution if the latter insists on an exclusive use. Yet, such screening is at odds with social goals: The incumbent is willing to pay more for exclusivity, the higher the demand (the lower the cost), that is precisely when competition yields the highest benefits. At the optimum, the incumbent's information impacts the decision of whether to build the infrastructure, but is not used to determine market structure.

As we have acknowledged, our ability to answer confidently many of the issues raised here questions is likely to increase as the open source movement itself grows and evolves. At the same time, it is heartening to us how much of open source activities can be understood within existing economic frameworks, despite the presence of claims to the contrary. The labor and industrial organization literatures provide lenses through which the structure of open source projects, the role of contributors, and the movement's ongoing evolution can be viewed.", "authors": ["eple60", "epti33"], "abstractStem": "thi paper review our understand of the grow open sourc movement we highlight how mani aspect of open sourc softwar appear initi puzzl to an economist as we have acknowledg our abil to answer confid mani of the issu rais here question is like to increas as the open sourc movement itself grow and evolv at the same time it is hearten to us how much of open sourc activ can be understood within exist econom framework despit the presenc of claim to the contrari the labor and industri organ literatur provid lens through which the structur of open sourc project the role of contributor and the movement ongo evolut can be view", "title": "The Economics of Technology Sharing: Open Source and Beyond"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v105y2015i6p1665-82.html": {"abstract": "Jean Tirole delivered his Prize Lecture on 8 December 2014 at the Aula Magna, Stockholm University.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epti33"], "abstractStem": "jean tirol deliv hi prize lectur on 8 decemb 2014 at the aula magna stockholm universitypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Market Failures and Public Policy"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/prs/reveco/reco_0035-2764_1985_num_36_5_408873.html": {"abstract": "[fre] L'article proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une revue de la litt\u00e9rature th\u00e9orique sur la recherche-d\u00e9veloppe\u00adment.

[eng] The economics of R-D Introduction to the pure theory Roger Guesnerie, Jean Tirole The article reviews the theoretical literature on R-D. Two themes are considered : the comparison of private and social value of an innovation, the competition for an innovation ; innovations being protected by patents. The private incentives to innovate are first examined according to the modalities of the exploitation of the invention and according to the pre and post innovation market structure (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly). The second part focuses on models where competition for innovation is formalized as a race and where preemption has a crucial role.", "authors": ["epgu36", "epti33"], "abstractStem": "fre larticl proc de   une revu de la litt ratur th oriqu sur la recherch velopp ment il abord deux th me principaux  valeur priv e et valeur social dune inno vation brevet e comp tition pour linnov le incit priv es   linnov sont dabord examin es en fonction de la formul adopt e pour lexploit dune invent brevet uniqu licenc de brevet et de la structur du march  pr  et post innov concurr monopol oligopol la second parti concentr lattent sur le mod le o  la comp tition pour linnov est assimil e   une cours et o  le ph nom ne de pr emption joue un r le d termin eng the econom of rd introduct to the pure theori roger guesneri jean tirol the articl review the theoret literatur on rd two theme are consid  the comparison of privat and social valu of an innov the competit for an innov  innov be protect by patent the privat incent to innov are first examin accord to the modal of the exploit of the invent and accord to the pre and post innov market structur perfect competit monopoli oligopoli the second part focus on model where competit for innov is formal as a race and where preemption ha a crucial role", "title": "L'\u00e9conomie de la recherche-d\u00e9veloppement : introduction \u00e0 certains travaux th\u00e9oriques"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v99y2009i2p459-65.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epbe27", "epti33"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Over My Dead Body: Bargaining and the Price of Dignity"}}}
