Important ideas contributed by Friedman, Lucas, and the developers of the sticky-price macro model generate this type of aggregate behavior. But the real-business cycle model shows that the neoclassical model implies anything but smooth growth. A purely neoclassical model, devoid of anything resembling a business cycle in the sense of transitory departures from neoclassical equilibrium, nevertheless explains most of the volatility of GDP growth at all frequencies. Monetary policymakers looking to a neoclassical model to provide the neutral levels of key variables-potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment, and the equilibrium real interest rate, need to solve a complicated and controversial model to find these constructs. They cannot take average or smoothed values of actual data to find them. Further, low-frequency movements of unemployment suggest a failure of the basic idea that departures from the neoclassical equilibrium are transitory. I discuss new theories of the labor market capable of explaining the low-frequency movements of unemployment. I conclude that monetary policymakers should not try to discern neutral values of real variables. Some branches of modem theory do not support the concepts of potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment, and the equilibrium real interest rate.

New Keynesian macro models have multipliers in that range as well. On the other hand, neoclassical models have a much lower multiplier, because they predict that consumption falls when purchases rise. The key features of a model that delivers a higher multiplier are (1) the decline in the markup ratio of price over cost that occurs in those models when output rises, and (2) the elastic response of employment to an increase in demand. These features alone deliver a fairly high multiplier and they are complementary to another feature associated with Keynes, the linkage of consumption to current income.

In the Great Depression, substantial deflation caused the real interest rate to reach high levels.

Fortunately, the inflation rate hardly responded to conditions in product and labor markets, else deflation might have occurred, with an even higher real interest rate. I concentrate on three closely related sources of declines in demand: the buildup of excess stocks of housing and consumer durables, the corresponding expansion of consumer debt that financed the buildup, and financial frictions that resulted from the decline in real-estate prices.

Evidence is presented that most unemployed workers became unemployed because their previous jobs came to an end; only a minority are on temporary layoff or have just entered the labor force. Thus, high-unemployment labor markets are generally ones where jobs are brief and there is a large flow of newly jobless workers. The model of the duration of employment posits that employment arrangements are the efficient outcome of the balancing of workers' and employers' interests about the length of jobs. Full equilibrium in the labor market also requires that the rate at which unemployed workers find new jobs be efficient. The factors influencing the resulting natural unemployment rate are discussed. Under plausible assumptions, the natural rate is independent of the supply or demand for labor. Only the costs of recruiting, the costs of turnover to employers, the efficiency of matching jobs and workers, and the cost of unemployment to workers are likely to influence the natural rate of unemployment strongly.

We develop a model based on standard economic assumptions and argue that this is indeed the case. Standard preferences - of the kind used widely in economics to study consumption, asset pricing, and labor supply - imply that health spending is a superior good with an income elasticity well above one. As people get richer and consumption rises, the marginal utility of consumption falls rapidly. Spending on health to extend life allows individuals to purchase additional periods of utility. The marginal utility of life extension does not decline. As a result, the optimal composition of total spending shifts toward health, and the health share grows along with income.

At the equilibrium unemployment rate, employers cannot obtain labor at lower cost by offering work at below the market wage to the unemployed. Unemployed workers cannot raise their effective real incomes by taking lower wages in exchange for immediate employment. The task of the theory is to explain why any unemployment remains at all when these conditions are satisfied. Part of this problem has been studied in detail in the \"search theory\" of unemployment -- once a worker becomes unemployed, it is reasonably well understood why the worker does not become employed again immediately. The theory of why people become unemployed in the first place is less well developed and is the main concern of this paper. Most of the unemployed are looking for new work because their previous jobs ran out. Consequently, the main ingredient of a theory of the flow of workers into unemployment is a theory of the duration of employment. Such a theory is developed here, along reasonably standard lines.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "fluctuat in the equilibrium rate of unemploy can onli be understood within a theori of the natur or equilibrium rate it is not enough to say that unemploy is the differ between suppli and demand in the labor market though of cours it alway will be in equilibrium no particip in the market can have an unexploit opportun to make themselv better off at the equilibrium unemploy rate employ cannot obtain labor at lower cost by offer work at below the market wage to the unemploy unemploy worker cannot rais their effect real incom by take lower wage in exchang for immedi employ the task of the theori is to explain whi ani unemploy remain at all when these condit are satisfi part of thi problem ha been studi in detail in the search theori of unemploy  onc a worker becom unemploy it is reason well understood whi the worker doe not becom employ again immedi the theori of whi peopl becom unemploy in the first place is less well develop and is the main concern of thi paper most of the unemploy are look for new work becaus their previou job ran out consequ the main ingredi of a theori of the flow of worker into unemploy is a theori of the durat of employ such a theori is develop here along reason standard linespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Fluctuations in Equilibrium Unemployment"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v91y2001i2p1-11.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Struggling to Understand the Stock Market"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jlabec/v2y1984i2p233-57.html": {"abstract": "Excessive layoffs in bad times and excessive quits in good times both stem from the same weakness in practical employment arrangements: the specific nature of worker-firm relations creates a situation of bilateral monopoly.

This paper starts with a serious empirical examination of the view that the labor market is always in balance-that every observed combination of employment and compensation is a point of intersection of the relevant supply and demand curves. I will call this the \"intertemporal substitution\" model of fluctuations. According to this model, workers are willing to shift their hours of work from one year to another in response to modest shifts in relative wages. The paper goes on to point out a strong implication of the pure inter- temporal substitution model, namely, the irrelevance of changes in the money supply for the labor supply function. A model where markets clear instantly ought to obey full monetary neutrality. The data refute this implication absolutely unambiguously. The money stock unambiguously shifts the labor supply function. The pure substitution model seems untenable in the light of this evidence. The paper then turns to explanations of the nonneutrality of money in the short run. According to the most carefully worked out line of thought, monetary shocks cause workers to make inappropriate intertemporal shifts in labor supply, because they lack complete information about the source of aggregate shocks and are forced to respond in the same way to real and nominal disturbances. Finally, the paper turns to the view that, in the short run, labor supply is largely irrelevant to the determination of aggregate employment.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "issu of labor suppli are at the heart of macroeconom explan of the larg cyclic fluctuat of output observ in modern economi thi paper start with a seriou empir examin of the view that the labor market is alway in balancethat everi observ combin of employ and compens is a point of intersect of the relev suppli and demand curv i will call thi the intertempor substitut model of fluctuat accord to thi model worker are will to shift their hour of work from one year to anoth in respons to modest shift in rel wage the paper goe on to point out a strong implic of the pure inter tempor substitut model name the irrelev of chang in the money suppli for the labor suppli function a model where market clear instantli ought to obey full monetari neutral the data refut thi implic absolut unambigu the money stock unambigu shift the labor suppli function the pure substitut model seem unten in the light of thi evid the paper then turn to explan of the nonneutr of money in the short run accord to the most care work out line of thought monetari shock caus worker to make inappropri intertempor shift in labor suppli becaus they lack complet inform about the sourc of aggreg shock and are forc to respond in the same way to real and nomin disturb final the paper turn to the view that in the short run labor suppli is larg irrelev to the determin of aggreg employmentpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Labor supply and aggregate fluctuations"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v5y1974i1974-2p343-410.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The Process of Inflation in the Labor Market"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v1y1970i1970-3p369-410.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Why Is the Unemployment Rate So High at Full Employment?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v26y1995i1995-1p221-274.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Lost Jobs"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v55y2008i5p980-982.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epha128"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Discussion of \"Aggregate implications of indivisible labor, incomplete markets, and labor-market frictions\" by Per Krusell, Toshihiko Mukoyama, Richard Rogerson, and Aysegul Sahin"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v117y2009i2p281-323.html": {"abstract": " Recessions appear to be times when the marginal rate of substitution between goods and workers' time falls below the marginal product of labor.

The only important exception is the indexing of wages to the cost of living. 2. Employers are permitted wide discretion in determining the level of employment when demand shifts unexpectedly. As employment varies, total compensation varies according to a formula established in the agreement. 3. Agreements are not permanent but are renegotiated on a regular cycle. 4. In the process of renegotiation, the current state of demand has little impact on the new wage schedule. On the other hand, current wages in other industries have an important influence.

Debate on health policy often focuses on limiting the growth of health spending. We investigate an issue central to this debate: Is the growth of health spending a rational response to changing economic conditions\u2014notably the growth of income per person? We develop a model based on standard economic assumptions and argue that this is indeed the case. Standard preferences\u2014of the kind used widely in economics to study consumption, asset pricing, and labor supply\u2014imply that health spending is a superior good with an income elasticity well above one.

The Great Depression followed. The second-worst struck in the fall of 2008 and the Great Recession followed. Commentators have dwelt endlessly on the causes of these and other deep financial collapses. This article pursues modern answers to a different question: why does output and employment collapse after a financial crisis and remain at low levels for several or many years after the crisis. It focuses on events in the United States since 2008. Existing macroeconomic models account successfully for the immediate effects of a financial crisis on output and employment. I will lay out a simple macro model that captures the most important features of modern models and show that realistic increases in financial frictions that occurred in the crisis of late 2008 will generate declines in real GDP and employment of the magnitude that occurred. But this model cannot explain why GDP and employment failed to recover once the financial crisis subsided\u2014the model implies a recovery as soon as financial frictions return to normal.

Consequently, the outcome of the bargain depends on the relative costs of delays to the parties, rather than on the payoffs that result from exiting negotiations.

The typical worker today is holding a job which has lasted or will last about eight years. Over a quarter of all workers are holding jobs which will last twenty years or more. Sixty percent hold jobs which will last five years or more. 2. The jobs held by middle-aged workers with more than ten years of tenure are extremely stable.
