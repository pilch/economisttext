Under incomplete information We study a model of spatial duopoly competition with sequential entry on a segment in the choice of locations (stage 1 of the game) and then simultaneous competition in delivery prices (stage 2). The second mover at stage one has incomplete information on the marginal cost (high or low) of the first mover. Hence, we obtain a signalling game in which there exist naturel constraints on the range of possible signais. The focus of the analysis is the identification and characterization of perfect Bayesian equilibria robust to some refinements criteria (the intuitive criterion and Dl) when the constraints on the signals are tight. The main result is that the separating equilibrium is no longer the only equilibrium surviving the Dl criterion. An important consequence of this resuit is that the robust equilibria become highly sensitive to the prior beliefs of the players. For a given interval of locations, the higher the cost difference between the low type and the high type of first movers, the more often the constraints will be tight. The characterization of the role of these constraints requires a systematic description of ail the equilibria and of their dependence on prior beliefs.

On consid\u00e8re un duopole dans lequel la concurrence se d\u00e9roule en deux phases. Au cours d'une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, une premi\u00e8re firme dont le co\u00fbt n'est pas connu de la seconde mais qui conna\u00eet le 'co\u00fbt de cette derni\u00e8re, choisit sa localisation sur un segment de droite. Cette localisation est observ\u00e9e par la seconde firme qui d\u00e9termine ensuite sa propre localisation sur le m\u00eame segment. Au cours d'une seconde phase, les firmes se font concurrence en prix. La localisation de la premi\u00e8re firme peut donc servir de signal sur son co\u00fbt. La notion d'\u00e9quilibre pertinent pour ce type de jeu est l'\u00e9quilibre bay\u00e9sien parfait.

To take into account the strategic interactions between firms and the consumers' rationality when confronted with advertising, we develop a duopoly model \u00e0 la Bertrand in which equilibrium prices do transmit information on product quality. The use of false regular prices appears then as the transmission of an indirect and false information on the product quality. We derive and characterize the bargain price equilibrium when consumers make a rational use of prices (although they may still be misled at times) to infer product qualities. Hence the model captures essential aspects of markets with advertising: consumers are rational and firms are engaged in a strategic game with differentiated products.

The quantitative analysis pays particular attention to measuring the trade-off between rent extraction and incentives for efficiency. The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: First, it appears that pure price-cap regulation leaves substantial rent to the firm relative to the other regimes. Second, introducing room for downward price flexibility improves efficiency of price-cap over Schmalensee's linear regulatory regimes. Finally, by correcting in part for the distributional distortion of price-cap, the profit-sharing mechanism often yields levels of welfare comparable to optimal regulation levels.

We first show that because of informational asymmetries the agency will tend to prohibit entry. However with a rational political principal, the threat of regulatory capture increases the likelihood of entry. The effect of regulatory capture on incentives in the natural monopoly is also studied and the results are discussed and extended in various ways.

Centralization always dominates (at least weakly) delegation. With limits on communication (incomplete contracting), collusion may have some bite under centralization. Limits on communication introduce an anonymity condition on the contract, creating a conflict between participation and coalition incentive constraints under centralization.

In particular, the banks who finance the firms causing environmental damages may be considered liable. In various court cases, banks have been found liable, while they have been exempted in others. We develop a multipricipal-agent model in which the insurance sector may insure the firm for the pollution risk and the bank may lend money for investment. Under complete information of the bank about the firm's activities, the limited liability of the firm induces excessive investment and sufficient care but full liability of the bank creates the appropriate internalization of the environmental risk. This rationalization of the law must be qualified because in general the bank suffers from agency problems (adverse selection and moral hazard) with respect to the firm. In the adverse selection case, full liability of the bank leads to underinvestment. Partial liability is better but may fail to implement the optimal second best allocation. In the case of moral hazard, full responsibility is killing the project too often while still leading to low care too often. Partial responsibility may achieve the second best optimal allocation but in some cases the level of responsibility necessary to induce the proper level of care is too high for the project to be financed by the bank.

A worker's full cost is defined by the sum of production cost in the public sector and reservation utility in the private sector.

The durability of output gives rise to inventory fluctuations which influence the course of the equilibria attained. One special feature of interest is the assumption that prices are not at the level which would equilibrate all markets if there were no stochastic shocks to the economy. With prices frozen at this level, the nature of the realized shocks determines the type of disequilibrium realized and the unintended component of inventory change. The analysis concentrates on two questions: What is the statistical nature of the process governing the real wage, output, employment and inventories? And is it possible to test this model against the alternative hypothesis that prices are continually flexible even after the shocks have disturbed the system? We find that although these theories are similar in their qualitative structure, tests can be developed. We also show how the frequencies of different types of quantity-constrained equilibria vary with the stochastic specification.

The purpose of this note is to present the implementation problem and to give some results obtained in public economics.", "authors": ["epla127"], "abstractStem": "fre une caract ristiqu essentiel de syst me  conomiqu est la d centralis de linform lorsquun d cision collect doit  tre prise le d cideur social doit rassembl une inform dont chaqu agent poss de de  l ment quil est le seul   conna tre par suit il se pose le probl me du comport strat giqu vi vi de cett inform d tenu de fa on priv etant donn  une fonction de choix social qui associ aux caract ristiqu informationnel de agent une d cision collect souhait e par le d cideur social comment peuton la concr tiser cest dire trouver un jeu dont le  quilibr strat giqu condui sent   la d cision souhait e  lobjectif de cett note est dexpos la probl matiqu g n rale de la concr tisat et den pr senter quelqu r sultat pour de probl me classiqu d conomi publiqu eng imperfect inform and public econom jeanjacqu laffont decentr of inform is an essenti characterist of econom system to take a collect decis the decis maker must gather piec of inform which are privat own strateg behavior with respect to thi inform must then be expect given a social choic function which associ to agent inform characterist a collect d cision desir by th  d cision maker how is it possibl to implement it ie to find a game the strateg equilibria of which lead to the desir decis the purpos of thi note is to present the implement problem and to give some result obtain in public econom", "title": "Information imparfaite et \u00e9conomie publique"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v86y2002i3p327-334.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epla127"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Public economics yesterday, today and tomorrow"}}}
