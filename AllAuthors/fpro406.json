When the Federal Reserve chairman and other policymakers have believed that inflation is costly, that inflation responds to the deviation of output from a moderate estimate of capacity, and that monetary policy can affect output and prices, as was the case in the 1950s and the 1980s and beyond, policy was well tempered and macroeconomic outcomes were desirable. When policymakers held other beliefs, such as the view that monetary policy cannot stimulate a depressed economy or that slack is ineffective in reducing inflation, as was the case in the 1930s and the 1970s, policy and outcomes were undesirable. This finding suggests that the key characteristic to look for in future Federal Reserve chairs is a sound economic framework.

This aversion to inflation was the result of policymakers' beliefs that higher inflation could not raise output in the long run, that the level of output that would trigger increases in inflation was only moderate, and that inflation had large real costs in the medium and long runs. Furthermore, both narrative and empirical analysis indicates that policymakers were not wedded to free reserves or other faulty indicators in their implementation of policy. Empirical estimates of a forward-looking Taylor rule show that policymakers in the 1950s raised nominal interest rates more than one-for-one with increases in expected inflation, and suggests that monetary policy in the 1950s was more similar to policy in the 1980s and 1990s than to that in the late 1960s and 1970s. One implication of these findings is that the inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s must have been the result of a change in the conduct of policy.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpro406", "fpro407"], "abstractStem": "monetari polici in the unit state in the 1950 wa remark modern analysi of feder reserv record show that policymak had an overarch avers to inflat and were will to accept signific cost to prevent it from rise to even moder level thi avers to inflat wa the result of policymak belief that higher inflat could not rais output in the long run that the level of output that would trigger increas in inflat wa onli moder and that inflat had larg real cost in the medium and long run furthermor both narr and empir analysi indic that policymak were not wed to free reserv or other faulti indic in their implement of polici empir estim of a forwardlook taylor rule show that policymak in the 1950 rais nomin interest rate more than oneforon with increas in expect inflat and suggest that monetari polici in the 1950 wa more similar to polici in the 1980 and 1990 than to that in the late 1960 and 1970 one implic of these find is that the inflat of the late 1960 and 1970 must have been the result of a chang in the conduct of policypthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "A Rehabilitation of Monetary Policy in the 1950's"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v14y2000i2p149-169.html": {"abstract": "Changes in both the macroeconomy and in macroeconomics suggest that the IS-LM-AS model is no longer the best baseline model of short-run fluctuations for teaching and policy analysis.

The results provide no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed, they suggest that tax cuts may actually increase spending.

This paper shows that these changes in policy have resulted largely from changes in policymakers' beliefs about the functioning of the economy and the effects of policy. We document the changes in beliefs using contemporaneous discussions of the economy and policy by monetary and fiscal policymakers and, for the period since the late 1960s, using the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts. We find that policymakers' understanding of the economy has not exhibited steady improvement. Instead, the evidence reveals an evolution from a fairly crude but basically sound worldview in the 1950s, to a more sophisticated but deeply flawed model in the 1960s, to uncertainty and fluctuating beliefs in the 1970s, and finally to the modern worldview of the 1980s and 1990s. We establish a link between policymakers' beliefs and aggregate demand policy by examining narrative evidence on the motivation for key policy choices.
