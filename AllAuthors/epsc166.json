Emissions trading has been used in Japanese climate policy since 2005. However, major emission reductions have not been achieved and a functioning market does not exist. Hence, using an advanced Public Choice approach, we ask for the political reasons for the failure of ambitious carbon markets in Japan and how the earthquake has influenced the political chances of emissions trading. Also, we evaluate Public Choice\u2019s arguments and environmental policy making. We show that in Japan, even after some positive promising developments, chances for an ambitious carbon market are still very low.

In representative democracies governments quite often use an expansion of the social security policies for their own selfish purposes.

If the burden of taxation becomes visible and the government has to reduce its expenditures, no group of voters wants to carry the well visible and painful reductions of spending programmes, especially when the whole electorate benefits from tax rates, which are not increased further (or they may even be lower). Citizens in direct democracies have more possibilities to influence policy questions, e.g. in a referendum over a change in the government's policy. The empirical investigation of two referenda proposals concerning the future development of the Swiss social security system demonstrates that the decision of the electorate was based on various short and long term considerations.

With this paper we want to reopen the debate on how citizens can be involved in this process. We try to show how citizen preferences can be included in the process of pollution control through emission trading. We propose an emission trading system where all emission permits are initially allocated to households who are then allowed to sell them in the permit market or to withhold (at least some of) them in order to reduce total pollution. This proposal tries to overcome the fundamental disadvantage of traditional permit systems which neglect consumer preferences by solely distributing emission permits to producers / polluters. In our system the property right to nature is re-allocated to the households who obtain the opportunity of reducing actual emissions according to their personal preferences by withholding a part or all of the emission permits allotted to them. Such a change in environmental policy would mark a return to the traditional principles of consumer sovereignty by involving households (at least partially) in the social abatement decision process instead of excluding them. Another advantage of admitting households to the TEP market as sellers or buyers of permits is that this increases the number of agents in the permit market and thus significantly reduces the possibilities of strategic market manipulations.

First, using different measures of aggregate economic activity as reference variables in estimating the average tax burden, we examine the size and dynamics of the overburden traceable back to tax evasion. Second, exploiting cointegration techniques, we quantify the elasticity between tax evasion and the average tax rate in Italy.

Tax morale may be a key determinant to explain why people are honest. However, there are very few papers that explore the concept of tax morale theoretically and empirically. This study, based on the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey, therefore attempts to fill this gap in the literature, focusing on tax morale in Austria. Societal institutions such as trust or pride have been identified as key determinants that shape tax morale in Austria. Furthermore, a lower perceived compliance leads to a decrease of tax morale, which indicates that social comparisons are relevant.

Our results confirm the usual positive impact of institutional quality on official output and total factor productivity, and its negative impact on the size of the underground economy. However, once output is corrected for the shadow economy, the relationship between institutions and output becomes weaker. The impact of institutions on total (\u201ccorrected\u201d) factor productivity becomes insignificant. Differences in corrected output must then be attributed to differences in factor endowments.

The objective of this paper is to examine participation in the shadow economy by those who claim to be unemployed and in receipt of social security benefits but working surreptitiously in the shadow economy. In doing so, we provide a first attempt at gauging the contributions by the unemployed to shadow economy activity. It is of considerable policy interest to know how the extent and duration of shadow economy activity are influenced by changes in the unemployment rate. A significant positive relationship between shadow economy activity and unemployment can be said to generate employment cycles in the shadow economy, which if supported by welfare payments, distorts the equity in the social security system. We find that changes in unemployment contribute to the employment cycles in the shadow economy, which on the whole appears to increase duration spells in unemployment.", "authors": ["epba173", "epsc166"], "abstractStem": "although there ha been consider discuss on the size of the shadow economi compar littl attent ha been given to relationship between unemploy and particip in thi sector the object of thi paper is to examin particip in the shadow economi by those who claim to be unemploy and in receipt of social secur benefit but work surreptiti in the shadow economi in do so we provid a first attempt at gaug the contribut by the unemploy to shadow economi activ it is of consider polici interest to know how the extent and durat of shadow economi activ are influenc by chang in the unemploy rate a signific posit relationship between shadow economi activ and unemploy can be said to gener employ cycl in the shadow economi which if support by welfar payment distort the equiti in the social secur system we find that chang in unemploy contribut to the employ cycl in the shadow economi which on the whole appear to increas durat spell in unemploy", "title": "Unemployment and the Shadow Economy in the oecd"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/clr/wugarc/y1988v14i4p455.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epsc166"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Privatisierungen in Gro\u00dfbritannien.

We study one particularly important collective action problem: the environment. Using a large panel dataset covering 25 years for some countries, we find that, overall, citizens of European countries are more satisfied with the way democracy works in their country if (a) more environmental policies are in place and if (b) expenditures on the environment are higher, but environmental taxes are lower. The relation between environmental policy and life satisfaction is not as pronounced. The evidence for the effect of environmental quality on both satisfaction with democracy and life satisfaction is not very clear, although we find evidence that citizens value personal mobility (in terms of having a car) highly, but view the presence of trucks as unpleasant. We also document that parents, younger citizens, and those with high levels of educational attainment tend to care more about environmental issues than do non-parents, older citizens, and those with fewer years of schooling.
