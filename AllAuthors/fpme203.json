There are a number of reasons to suspect that it might not. Chief among them is the opaque set of accounting rules used to report pension assets, liabilities, and expenses. Pension plan assets and liabilities are off-balance sheet, and are often viewed as segregated from the rest of the firm, with its own trustees. Pension accounting rules are complicated. Furthermore, the role of Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation further clouds the real relation between pension plan risk and firm equity risk. The empirical findings in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that equity risk does reflect the risk of the firm's pension plan despite arcane accounting rules for pensions. This finding is consistent with informational efficiency of the capital markets. It also has implications for corporate finance practice in the determination of the cost of capital for capital budgeting. Standard procedure uses de-leveraged equity return betas to infer the cost of capital for operating assets. But the de-leveraged betas are not adjusted for the risk of the pension assets and liabilities. Failure to make this adjustment will typically bias upwards estimates of the discount rate for capital budgeting. The magnitude of the bias is shown here to be large for a number of well-known U.S. companies. This bias can result in positive net-present-value projects being rejected.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["fpbo569", "fpme203"], "abstractStem": "thi paper examin the empir question of whether systemat equiti risk of us firm as measur by beta from the capit asset price model reflect the risk of their pension plan there are a number of reason to suspect that it might not chief among them is the opaqu set of account rule use to report pension asset liabil and expens pension plan asset and liabil are offbal sheet and are often view as segreg from the rest of the firm with it own truste pension account rule are complic furthermor the role of pension benefit guaranti corpor further cloud the real relat between pension plan risk and firm equiti risk the empir find in thi paper are consist with the hypothesi that equiti risk doe reflect the risk of the firm pension plan despit arcan account rule for pension thi find is consist with inform effici of the capit market it also ha implic for corpor financ practic in the determin of the cost of capit for capit budget standard procedur use deleverag equiti return beta to infer the cost of capit for oper asset but the deleverag beta are not adjust for the risk of the pension asset and liabil failur to make thi adjust will typic bia upward estim of the discount rate for capit budget the magnitud of the bia is shown here to be larg for a number of wellknown us compani thi bia can result in posit netpresentvalu project be rejectedpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Do a firm's equity returns reflect the risk of its pension plan?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/rje/bellje/v5y1974ispringp145-170.html": {"abstract": " The findings of Jensen-Long and Stiglitz on the optimality of the stock market allocation have led to a controversy over whether the sources of the nonoptimality of value maximization are noncompetive assumptions about the capital market or are inherent externalities associated with uncertainty which do not disappear even in a competitive market. At least, for the mean-variance model with constant returns to scale technologies, we claim that the answer is the former, and that the sources of the nonoptimality are nonpricetaking behavior by firms, restrictions on the availability of technologies to firms, and restrictions on the number of firms that can enter. Using both tatonnement and nontatonnement processes, it is shown that if firms value maximize, then the Jensen-Long and Stiglitz equilibria are unstable with respect to the number of firms.

Since that time, numerous researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and the new \"down-and-out\" option are derived.

In finance, the stock market is the single most important market with respect to corporate investment decisions. In contrast, macroeconomic modelling and policy discussion assign a relatively minor role to the stockmarket in investment decisions. This paper explores four possible explanations for this neglect and concludes that macro analysis should give more attention to the stock market. Despite the frequent jibe that \"the stockmarket has forecast ten of the last six recessions,\" the stock market is in fact a good predictor of the business cycle and the components of GNP. We examine the relative importance of the required return on equity compared with the interest rate in the determination of the cost of capital, and hence,investment. In this connection, we review the empirical success of the Q theory of investment which relates investment to stock market evaluations of firms. One of the explanations for the neglect of the stock market in macroeconomics may be the view that because the stock market fluctuates excessively, rational managers will pay little attention to the market informulating investment plans. This view is shown to be unfounded by demonstrating that rational managers will react to stock price changes even if the stock market fluctuates excessively.
