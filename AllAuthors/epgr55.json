We estimate the quantiles of stock return distributions using non-parametric and parametric methods that are widely being used in measuring value-at-risk (VaR). We find that the average conditional correlation of 30 stocks is much higher when the large movements are negative than that when the market is 'usual'. Further, we find that, contrary to the results of previous studies, there is no notable difference between the average conditional correlations when the large movements are positive and when the market is 'usual'. Moreover, it is evident from the results of the conditional CAPM that the portfolio's diversifiable and non-diversifiable risks, as measured by the error variance of the CAPM and beta respectively, are highly unstable when the market is bearish than that when it is 'usual' or bullish. The overall results suggest that the possibility of portfolio diversification would be eroded when the stock market is bearish.

When weather variables are calculated in this way, accurate econometric models of electricity sales can be estimated.2.(2) If data on the number of customers in each cycle are unavailable, the first procedure can be applied under an assumption concerning the number of customers consuming on each day.

Alternatively, cointegration can be switched on or off because series normally believed to contain a unit actually do not.

Our approach approximates the nonstationary data locally by stationary models. The methodology is applied to the S&amp;P; 500 series of returns covering a period of over seventy years of market activity. We find most of the dynamics of this time series to be concentrated in shifts of the unconditional variance. The forecasts based on our nonstationary unconditional modeling were found to be superior to those obtained in a stationary long-memory framework and to those based on a stationary Garch(1, 1) data-generating process. \u00a9 2005 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "authors": ["epgr55"], "abstractStem": " the paper outlin a methodolog for analyz daili stock return that relinquish the assumpt of global stationar give up thi common work hypothesi reflect our belief that fundament featur of the financi market are continu and significantli chang our approach approxim the nonstationari data local by stationari model the methodolog is appli to the sampp 500 seri of return cover a period of over seventi year of market activ we find most of the dynam of thi time seri to be concentr in shift of the uncondit varianc the forecast base on our nonstationari uncondit model were found to be superior to those obtain in a stationari longmemori framework and to those base on a stationari garch1 1 datagener process   2005 presid and fellow of harvard colleg and the massachusett institut of technolog", "title": "Nonstationarities in Stock Returns"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v48y1980i5p1149-67.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epas1", "epgr55", "fpsc313"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Advertising and Aggregate Consumption: An Analysis of Causality"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/cuf/journl/y2001v2i1p97-100.html": {"abstract": "It is pointed out that if the generating mechanism is a fraction integrated process I(d), where d can be less than 1/2, but a simple ARMA model is fitted, a consistent estimation procedure is likely to produce a unit root.

We suggest that the use of high-frequency data in forecasting economic aggregates can increase the accuracy of forecasts. The best way of using this information is to build a single model that relates the data of all frequencies, for example, an ARMA model with missing observations. As an application of linking series generated at different frequencies, we show that the use of a monthly industrial production index improves the predictability of the quarterly GNP.

While data is now abundantly available due to the constant satellite surveillance of the Amazon, the analytical methods typically used to analyze the impact of roads on natural vegetation cover are methodologically weak and not very helpful in guiding public policy. This article discusses the respective weaknesses of typical geographic information system (GIS) analysis and typical municipality-level regression analysis, and shows what would be needed to construct an ideal model of deforestation processes. It also presents an alternative approach that is much less demanding in terms of modeling and estimation and is more useful for policymakers.
