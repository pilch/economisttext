Yet, since the 1970's when Lucas and Sargent presented powerful critiques of traditional neutrality tests, empirical researchers have made little progress on testing these propositions. In this paper we show that. in spite of the Lucas-Sargent critique. long run neutrality can be tested without specifying a complete model of economic activity. This is possible when the variables are integrated. In this case, permanent shifts in the historical data can be uncovered using VAR methods, and neutrality can be tested when there is a priori knowledge of one of the structural impact multipliers or one of the structural long run multipliers. In most circumstances such a priori knowledge is available. We use this framework to test four long run neutrality propositions: (i) the neutrality of money, (ii) the superneutrality of money. (iii) a vertical long run Phillips curve, and (iv) the Fisher effect. In each application, our a priori knowledge consists of a range of plausible values for the relevant impact and long run multipliers. We find that the U.S. postwar data are consistent with the neutrality of money and a vertical long run Phillips curve. but find evidence against the superneutrality of money and the long run Fisher relation. The sign of the estimated effect of money growth on output depends on the particular identifying assumption used. For a wide range of plausible identifying restrictions, nominal interest rates are found to move less than one-for-one with inflation in the long run.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epki21", "fpwa582"], "abstractStem": "proposit about long run neutral are at the heart of most macroeconom model yet sinc the 1970 when luca and sargent present power critiqu of tradit neutral test empir research have made littl progress on test these proposit in thi paper we show that in spite of the lucassarg critiqu long run neutral can be test without specifi a complet model of econom activ thi is possibl when the variabl are integr in thi case perman shift in the histor data can be uncov use var method and neutral can be test when there is a priori knowledg of one of the structur impact multipli or one of the structur long run multipli in most circumst such a priori knowledg is avail we use thi framework to test four long run neutral proposit i the neutral of money ii the superneutr of money iii a vertic long run phillip curv and iv the fisher effect in each applic our a priori knowledg consist of a rang of plausibl valu for the relev impact and long run multipli we find that the us postwar data are consist with the neutral of money and a vertic long run phillip curv but find evid against the superneutr of money and the long run fisher relat the sign of the estim effect of money growth on output depend on the particular identifi assumpt use for a wide rang of plausibl identifi restrict nomin interest rate are found to move less than oneforon with inflat in the long runpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Testing long-run neutrality"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v22y1986i2-3p147-151.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpwa582"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Does GNP have a unit root?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bes/jnlbes/v6y1988i4p408-09.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpwa582"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "A Reexamination of Friedman's Consumption Puzzle: Comment"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/compec/v20y2002i1-2p57-86.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epki21", "fpwa582"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "System Reduction and Solution Algorithms for Singular Linear Difference Systems under Rational Expectations"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/jof/jforec/v23y2004i6p405-430.html": {"abstract": " This paper uses forecast combination methods to forecast output growth in a seven-country quarterly economic data set covering 1959-1999, with up to 73 predictors per country.

Second, are there gains from using information from additional predictors beyond simple univariate time series forecasts, and if so, how large are these gains, and how are these gains best achieved? It turns out that typically there are gains from forecasting these series at the country level, then pooling the forecasts, relative to forecasting at the aggregate level. This suggests that structural macroeconometric modeling of the Euro area is appropriately done at the country-specific level, rather than directly at the aggregate level.

Broadly speaking, there are two approaches in the literature.

The second approach, which has been the focus of more recent academic and applied work, is to look for turning points in a few, or just one, aggregate. This paper examines these two approaches to the identification of turning points. We provide a nonparametric definition of a turning point (an estimand) based on a population of time series. This leads to estimators of turning points, sampling distributions, and standard errors for turning points based on a sample of series.

We characterize the type and magnitude of instabilities under which the principal components estimator of the factors is consistent and find that these instabilities can be larger than earlier theoretical calculations suggest. We also discuss implications of our results for the robustness of regressions based on the estimated factors and of estimates of the number of factors in the presence of parameter instability. Simulations calibrated to an empirical application indicate that instability in the factor loadings has a limited impact on estimation of the factor space and diffusion index forecasting, whereas estimation of the number of factors is more substantially affected.", "authors": ["fpwa582"], "abstractStem": "thi paper consid the estim of approxim dynam factor model when there is tempor instabl in the factor load we character the type and magnitud of instabl under which the princip compon estim of the factor is consist and find that these instabl can be larger than earlier theoret calcul suggest we also discuss implic of our result for the robust of regress base on the estim factor and of estim of the number of factor in the presenc of paramet instabl simul calibr to an empir applic indic that instabl in the factor load ha a limit impact on estim of the factor space and diffus index forecast wherea estim of the number of factor is more substanti affect", "title": "Consistent factor estimation in dynamic factor models with structural instability"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bes/jnlbes/v14y1996i1p11-30.html": {"abstract": " An experiment is performed to assess the prevalence of instability in univariate and bivariate macroeconomic time series relations and to ascertain whether various adaptive forecasting techniques successfully handle any such instability.

Which approach is better is an empirical matter: in theory, iterated forecasts are more efficient if correctly specified, but direct forecasts are more robust to model misspecification. This paper compares empirical iterated and direct forecasts from linear univariate and bivariate models by applying simulated out-of-sample methods to 171 US monthly macroeconomic time series spanning 1959-2002. The iterated forecasts typically outperform the direct forecasts, particularly if the models can select long lag specifications.
