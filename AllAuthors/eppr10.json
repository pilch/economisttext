During the same period, there was little change in the capital\u2014output ratio or earnings share of output. We ask specifically whether the theory accounts for these observations.

Today, it is widely acknowledged that labor supply matters for many key economic issues, particularly for business cycles and tax policy analysis. However, the extent to which labor supply matters for such questions depends on the aggregate labor supply elasticity\u2014that is, the sensitivity of the time allocation between market and nonmarket activities. For several decades, the magnitude of the aggregate labor supply elasticity has been the subject of much debate. In this article, we review the debate and conclude that the elasticity of labor supply of the aggregate household is much higher than the elasticity of the identical households being aggregated. The aggregate household utility function differs from the individuals\u2019 utility functions for the same reason that the aggregate production function differs from the individual firms\u2019 production functions being aggregated.
