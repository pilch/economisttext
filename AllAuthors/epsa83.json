One implies an exploitable inflation-unemployment trade-off, the other does not. The policy maker's prior probability over the two models is part of his state vector. Bayes' law converts the prior probability into a posterior probability and gives the policy maker an incentive to experiment. For models calibrated to U.S. data through the early 1960s, we compare the outcomes from two Bellman equations. The first tells the policy maker to \"experiment and learn.\" The second tells him to \"learn but don't experiment.\" In this way, we isolate a component of government policy that is due to experimentation and estimate the benefits from intentional experimentation. We interpret the Bellman equation that learns but does not intentionally experiment as an \"anticipated utility\" model and study how well its outcomes approximate those from the \"experiment and learn\" Bellman equation. The approximation is good. For our calibrations, the benefits from purposeful experimentation are small because random shocks are big enough to provide ample unintentional experimentation.

Under our calibration, with high unemployment benefits, an increase in turbulence increases the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment while leaving the inflow rate into unemployment roughly unchanged, mirroring features of European data in the 1980s and 1990s. The essential issue is that den Haan, Haefke, and Ramey specify that in turbulent times workers experiencing layoffs and quits are both subject to instantaneous skill losses, while we restrict instantaneous skill losses to laid-off workers.
