There are three basic problems with this approach. First, the same lag structure is imposed on all variables, and such independent variables enters only as a current value. In contrast a rational individual would respond to different variables (income, interest rates, prices) with quite different lags. Second, when the general price level is subject to gradual adjustment but can move quickly in response to supply shocks, the influence of these supply shocks should enter with a negative sign. Third, the estimated equation for real balances may not be a money demand equation at all, but rather its coefficients may represent a shifting mixture of demand and supply responses. The empirical work examines several alternative dynamic specifications, including a generalized partial adjustment framework and the error-correction model. Both of the latter specifications exhibit greater structural stability after 1973 than the standard partial adjustment model, and the generalized partial adjustment model also yields relatively small errors in post-sample dynamic simulations. Shifts in coefficients as the sample period is extended after 1973 are consistent with the interpretation that the real balance equation no longer traces out structural demand parameters, but rather a mixture of demand and supply responses.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epgo50"], "abstractStem": "the partialadjust approach to the specif of the shortrun demand for money ha domin the literatur for more than a decad there are three basic problem with thi approach first the same lag structur is impos on all variabl and such independ variabl enter onli as a current valu in contrast a ration individu would respond to differ variabl incom interest rate price with quit differ lag second when the gener price level is subject to gradual adjust but can move quickli in respons to suppli shock the influenc of these suppli shock should enter with a neg sign third the estim equat for real balanc may not be a money demand equat at all but rather it coeffici may repres a shift mixtur of demand and suppli respons the empir work examin sever altern dynam specif includ a gener partial adjust framework and the errorcorrect model both of the latter specif exhibit greater structur stabil after 1973 than the standard partial adjust model and the gener partial adjust model also yield rel small error in postsampl dynam simul shift in coeffici as the sampl period is extend after 1973 are consist with the interpret that the real balanc equat no longer trace out structur demand paramet but rather a mixtur of demand and suppli responsespthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "The Short-run Demand for Money: A Reconsideration"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v37y1993i4p689-695.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpde575", "epgo50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Inflation, money and growth : An introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v65y1997i6p1443-1452.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epgo50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "What is the Econometric Society?

S. labor productivity growth since 1995. The vast majority of the literature focuses on the American growth revival. But close to half of the turnaround was caused by a European retardation. What caused that retardation? Our paper shows that none of the consensus explanations of the American revival provide any help at all in explaining the European retardation. It is sui generis and therein lies a tale that has not previously been told. ; Europe has faltered across the board. The deceleration of its productivity growth is not explained at all by ICT production and only to a small degree by retailing/wholesaling. Rather, the big European countries have failed in nearly every dimension. The retardation of Europe is illuminated by dividing up the EU-15 countries into Tigers, a Middle group, and Tortoises. ; Our first surprise in examining the data is to find that the EU-US turnaround in labor productivity growth was not just a reflection of an equivalent turnaround in total factor productivity growth. Capital deepening also faltered in Europe, indicting all the macroeconomic determinants of economy-wide investment as part of Europe\u2019s problem. ; The most striking aspect of our results is that the failing of the Tortoise countries is widespread, spanning industries as diverse as agriculture, wholesale trade, mining, chemicals, construction, fabricated metals, and clothing. Our explanation is that Europe\u2019s previous catch-up to the U. S. productivity level before 1995 was artificial \u2013 by making labor expensive, Europe raised its average product. But after 1995 as labor market reforms have helped to make labor cheaper, so the average product of labor has been pushed down and its growth rate has faltered.

A simple version of the Gordon-Phelps model shows that the necessary condition for actual real GNP to be maintained at its equilibrium level in the wake of a supply shock is for the change innominal GNP to exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in the income share of the raw material in GNP. The required \"wedge\" between nominal GNP and wage growth can be accomplished by any combination of monetary accommodation and nominal wage flexibility. Without this combination a \"macroeconomic externality\" occurs, with real CNP falling below its equilibrium level. The obstacles to monetary accommodation are examined in terms of a taxonomic wage adjustment equation that allows for differing responses to current inflation, lagged inflation, and lagged wage change. Monetary accommodation is infeasible when there is full indexation to current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation following a one-time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged inflation. With \"forward-looking\" expectation formation in the sense of Taylor, a supply shock is likely to cause changes in parameters of the wage adjustment equation as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic externality.

S. stands in sharp contrast, with German unemployment much lower from 1960 to the early 19705 but substantially higher from 1984 to 1988. This paper provides a framework for examining the relationship between inflation and unemployment that sheds light on these developments. The theoretical section develops a new nonstructural model of wage and Price adjustment that integrates severa! concepts that have often been treated separately, including Phillips curve \"level effects,\" hysteresis \"change effects,\" the error-correction mechanism, and the role of changes in labor's share that act as a supply shock. The empirical analysis reaches rwo striking conclusions. First, during 1973-90coefficients in our German wage equations arc remarkably similar to those in the U.S., with almost identical estimates of the Phillips curve slope, of the hysteresis effect, and of the NAIRU. The two countries also share similar inflation behavior, in that inflation depends more closely on the capacity utilization rate than on the unemployment rate, The big difference berween the two countries is that there is no feedback from wages to prices in Germany, and so high unemployment does not put downward pressure on the inflation rate. During the 19705 and 19805 in Germany there emerged a growing mismatch between the labor market and industrial capacity, so that the unemployment rate consistent with the mean (constant-inflation) utilization rate (\"MURU\") increased sharply, while in the U. S. the MURU was relatively stable. The German utilization rate in late 1990was about 90 percent, considerably higher than the estimated MURU of 85 percent.

Several different statistical techniques suggest that wage rates in the U.K. and Japan are between three and 15 times more flexible than in the U.S. during the postwar period. Corresponding to greater flexibility in wages, these two countries also exhibit more stable employment behavior over the business cycle. In historical data covering the period between the late-nineteenth-century and 1940, U.S. wage behavior appears to be much more similar to that in Britain and Japan. The contrast between the prewar data and the postwar data, where the U.S. is a definite outlier, suggests that the 1948 invention of the three-year staggered U.S. wage contract may be the crucial factor underlying sluggish U.S. postwar wage dynamics. A theoretical section attempts to distill from recent literature those features of labor market institutions that are regarded as optimal by economic theory. Japanese institutions exhibit more similarity to this theoretical paradigm than those in the U.S. or U.K. Economic theory predicts that long-duration contracts, like those in the postwar U.S., are more likely to emerge when the perceived cost of renegotiation is high, but we must appeal to history and cultural differences to explain why conflict avoidance plays a more prominent role in the development of Japanese labor market institutions than in the American case. In this comparison Britain is the odd-man-out, with well-publicized industrial strife, together with short contract durations. I appeal to history, the different legal tradition, and the nature of the British unions themselves to explain why the three-year contract became established in America but not in Britain.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epgo50"], "abstractStem": "thi paper argu that rigid wage cannot provid the underpin of a univers valid theori of the busi cycl simpli becaus wage are not univers rigid sever differ statist techniqu suggest that wage rate in the uk and japan are between three and 15 time more flexibl than in the us dure the postwar period correspond to greater flexibl in wage these two countri also exhibit more stabl employ behavior over the busi cycl in histor data cover the period between the latenineteenthcenturi and 1940 us wage behavior appear to be much more similar to that in britain and japan the contrast between the prewar data and the postwar data where the us is a definit outlier suggest that the 1948 invent of the threeyear stagger us wage contract may be the crucial factor underli sluggish us postwar wage dynam a theoret section attempt to distil from recent literatur those featur of labor market institut that are regard as optim by econom theori japanes institut exhibit more similar to thi theoret paradigm than those in the us or uk econom theori predict that longdur contract like those in the postwar us are more like to emerg when the perceiv cost of renegoti is high but we must appeal to histori and cultur differ to explain whi conflict avoid play a more promin role in the develop of japanes labor market institut than in the american case in thi comparison britain is the oddmanout with wellpublic industri strife togeth with short contract durat i appeal to histori the differ legal tradit and the natur of the british union themselv to explain whi the threeyear contract becam establish in america but not in britainpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Why U.S. Wage and Employment Behaviour Differs from That in Britain and Japan"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v16y1981i1p1-6.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpde575", "epgo50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v25y1984i1p1-6.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpde575", "epgo50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v31y1987i3p537-542.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpde575", "epgo50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v71y1981i2p288-94.html": {"abstract": "This paper presents a single reduced-form inflation equation that can explain both the variance and acceleration of inflation during the 1970s.Inflation is explained by four sets of factors.

The adjustment of inflation to changes in aggregate demand is limited by the role of inertia in the inflation process, expressed as the dependence of the rate of change of prices on its own past values. Two types of supply-side elements enter. Government intervention directly altered the price level during the Nixon control era, and in addition the government has aggravated the inflation problem by what have been called \"self-inflicted wounds,\" including increases in the effective social security tax rate and effective minimum wage. Also there have been external supply shocks that are outside of the immediate control of the government, including changes in the relative prices of food and energy, changes in the growth rate of productivity, and changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Considerable attention is given to alternative methods of estimating the impact of direct episodes of government intervention In the price-setting process, particularly during the Nixon controls. We find that such episodes have been futile.

Results are based on a new data set that allows a consistent analysis of the aggregate economy, the manufacturing sector, and the nonmanufacturing sector. Results are presented for the U. S., Japan, and an aggregate called \"Europe\" consisting of eleven European economies. The primary theme of the paper is that differences between Europe and the U. S. have been substantially exaggerated in recent work. Europe has neither greater nominal wage flexibility nor more rigid real wages than the U. S. Evidence that the U. S. exhibits more nominal rigidity is confined to manufacturing, while the U. S. aggregate and nonmanufacturing sectors display as much nominal wage flexibility as Europe, and similar \"output sacrifice ratios\" as well. These results undermine the case frequently made against demand expansion in Europe on the ground that such a demand expansion would cause only extra inflation with no bonus of extra output as a result of a uniquely vertical European aggregate supply curve. The analysis of real wages also yields new results. A consistent treatment of the income of the self-employed almost completely eliminates the secular uptrend in previously developed wage gap indexes for Japan and Europe between the 1960s and 1980s. If anything real wages in Europe and Japan were too flexible rather than too rigid, in the sense that much of the increase in wage gap indexes in Europe during 1968-70 and in Japan in 1973-74 can be interpreted as autonomous wage push. The component of increases in wage gap indexes to be attributed to a failure of real wages to respond to the post-1972 productivity growth slowdown is relatively minor.

The alternative, dubbed \"NRH-GAP,\" states that prices respond fully in the long run, but only gradually in the short run, to nominal aggregate demand disturbances. A second innovation is the development of a quarterly data file for the period 1890-1980, thus opening up more than 200 new quarterly observations for analysis. A third innovation is the testing of three different methods of introducing \"persistence effects\" into the LSW analytical framework. In conflict with the predictions of the LSW approach, the results here exhibit uniformly high coefficients of real output and low coefficients of price changes in response to anticipated nominal GNP changes. Further, price changes respond positively and output responds negatively to lagged changes in prices, reflecting the short-run inertia in price-setting that forms the basis for the alter- native NRH-GAP approach. Evidence is also provided that velocity tends to respond negatively to anticipated changes in money, in contrast to the usual assumption in this literature of random serially independent velocity changes. Two shifts in the structure of the price-setting process are noted--a much higher degree of price responsiveness during World War I and its aftermath, and a longer mean lag in the influence of past price changes after 1953.

Primary among the new data sources are direct measures of output in the transportation, communications, and construction sectors, and estimates of the consumer price index. New measures of real GNP, nominal GNP, and the GNP deflator are developed. The new estimates of real GNP are as volatile, on average, over the business cycle as the traditional Kuznets-Kendrick series, but dampen the amplitude of som e cycles while raising the amplitude of others. The new estimates of th e GNP deflator are distinctly less volatile than the traditional series and, in fact, no more volatile than those in the postwar period.
