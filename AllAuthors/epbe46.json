Even in countries, such as Britain, that have relied on a national health care system for 50 years, there has always been an active private sector, catering to those who do not wish to use the National Health Service (NHS). For the most part, these are individuals who also smooth their medical payments by purchasing private insurance. If they become sick, then they consume treatment in the private rather than the public sector. This report studies the demand for private health insurance in the UK using data from the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey. According to this, around 14% of British households have private health insurance, with a roughly equal split between individual and employer provision. Here, we are mainly concerned with determinants of demand for individual purchases. Our specific focus is on how this demand is related to aspects of NHS performance such as waiting-lists and measures of satisfaction with the NHS in the BSA data. While measures such as waiting-lists are frequently discussed as barometers of NHS performance, little evidence exists of their actual role in insurance demand. There are good reasons why we would expect that private insurance demand would respond to the state of the NHS. Private insurance provides a means by which individuals can reduce their reliance on the NHS as a source of health care. It is natural for them to take such a course if they are unhappy with aspects of the NHS. If the perceived or real quality of NHS provision declines, then individuals may choose to go private in greater numbers. We look for evidence that private insurance is fulfilling this function. Our main finding is that there is a positive association between the purchase of private health insurance and length of local NHS waiting-lists.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epbe46", "eppr2"], "abstractStem": "a key dimens of differenti between health care system concern the rel role of the public and privat sector in deliv care even in countri such as britain that have reli on a nation health care system for 50 year there ha alway been an activ privat sector cater to those who do not wish to use the nation health servic nh for the most part these are individu who also smooth their medic payment by purchas privat insur if they becom sick then they consum treatment in the privat rather than the public sector thi report studi the demand for privat health insur in the uk use data from the british social attitud bsa survey accord to thi around 14 of british household have privat health insur with a roughli equal split between individu and employ provis here we are mainli concern with determin of demand for individu purchas our specif focu is on how thi demand is relat to aspect of nh perform such as waitinglist and measur of satisfact with the nh in the bsa data while measur such as waitinglist are frequent discuss as baromet of nh perform littl evid exist of their actual role in insur demand there are good reason whi we would expect that privat insur demand would respond to the state of the nh privat insur provid a mean by which individu can reduc their relianc on the nh as a sourc of health care it is natur for them to take such a cours if they are unhappi with aspect of the nh if the perceiv or real qualiti of nh provis declin then individu may choos to go privat in greater number we look for evid that privat insur is fulfil thi function our main find is that there is a posit associ between the purchas of privat health insur and length of local nh waitinglistspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "The demand for private health insurance: do waiting lists matter?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v58y1995i1p73-84.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epbe46", "epje50"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Uniform taxation and consumer preferences"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jeurec/v9y2011i3p371-398.html": {"abstract": "It is widely recognized that fragile states are key symptoms of under-development in many parts of the world.

As a central plank, these goals include halving the proportion of people living below a dollar a day from around 30 percent of the developing world's population in 1990 to 15 percent by 2015--a reduction in the absolute number of poor of around one billion. This paper examines what economic research can tell us about how to fulfill these goals. It begins by discussing poverty trends on a global scale--where the poor are located in the world and how their numbers have been changing over time. It then discusses the relationship of economic growth and income distribution to poverty reduction. Finally, it suggests an evidence-based agenda for poverty reduction in the developing world.", "authors": ["epbe46", "epbu12"], "abstractStem": "the millennium develop goalsglob target that the world leader set at the millennium summit in septemb 2000are an ambiti agenda for reduc poverti as a central plank these goal includ halv the proport of peopl live below a dollar a day from around 30 percent of the develop world popul in 1990 to 15 percent by 2015a reduct in the absolut number of poor of around one billion thi paper examin what econom research can tell us about how to fulfil these goal it begin by discuss poverti trend on a global scalewher the poor are locat in the world and how their number have been chang over time it then discuss the relationship of econom growth and incom distribut to poverti reduct final it suggest an evidencebas agenda for poverti reduct in the develop world", "title": "Halving Global Poverty"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/niesru/v224y2013i1pr1-r13.html": {"abstract": "What policies and institutions are needed to sustain long-run growth in the UK? We describe an optimistic story of the UK economy over the past 30 years. From the late 1970s, the UK reversed a century of relative decline in terms of per capita GDP with our main counterparts in the US, France and Germany. A key factor behind this improvement was an array of policy changes including an expansion of higher education and greater competition in product and labour markets. However, major weaknesses with respect to long-run investment in human capital, infrastructure and innovation remain. These are hampered by problems of short-termism and policy risk. We propose a series of radical reforms to address these problems: such as more flexibility in schooling with a new focus on disadvantage; a new architecture for national infrastructure decisions and more competition in banking.", "authors": ["epbe46", "epva45"], "abstractStem": "what polici and institut are need to sustain longrun growth in the uk we describ an optimist stori of the uk economi over the past 30 year from the late 1970 the uk revers a centuri of rel declin in term of per capita gdp with our main counterpart in the us franc and germani a key factor behind thi improv wa an array of polici chang includ an expans of higher educ and greater competit in product and labour market howev major weak with respect to longrun invest in human capit infrastructur and innov remain these are hamper by problem of shortterm and polici risk we propos a seri of radic reform to address these problem such as more flexibl in school with a new focu on disadvantag a new architectur for nation infrastructur decis and more competit in bank", "title": "Investing for Prosperity: Skills, Infrastructure and Innovation"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v17y1989i12p1921-1930.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epaz45", "epbe46"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "General equilibrium with parallel markets for goods and foreign exchange: Theory and application to Ghana"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v96y2006i3p720-736.html": {"abstract": "It has long been recognized that the media play an essential role in government accountability.
