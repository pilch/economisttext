Criticisms run from corrupt deals to abuse of market power and social welfare losses. We evaluate the empirical record on privatization, relying on recent comprehensive studies from Latin America. The paper presents four main results. First, the increased profitability of privatized firms is not explained by sample selection biases. Second, in the quest to identify the sources of increased profitability after privatization, we find little evidence that validates concerns of generalized market power abuses, exploitation of workers, and lack of fiscal benefits. Third, the manner in which privatization is carried out matters. Transparency and homogeneity in procedures, speed, and limited restructuring prior to privatization lead to better outcomes and less room for corruption and discretion. Finally, privatization\u00b4s success is enhanced by two complementary policies: deregulation or reregulation of industries previously shielded from competitive forces; and an effective corporate governance framework that facilitates privatized firms\u00b4 access to capital at lower cost. Overall, the empirical record shows that privatization leads to increased profitability and productivity, firm restructuring, fiscal benefits, output growth, and even quality improvements. Most cases of privatization failure can be linked to poor contract design, opaque processes with heavy state involvement, lack of reregulation, and a poor corporate governance framework.", "authors": ["eplo137"], "abstractStem": "privat is under attack critic run from corrupt deal to abus of market power and social welfar loss we evalu the empir record on privat reli on recent comprehens studi from latin america the paper present four main result first the increas profit of privat firm is not explain by sampl select bias second in the quest to identifi the sourc of increas profit after privat we find littl evid that valid concern of gener market power abus exploit of worker and lack of fiscal benefit third the manner in which privat is carri out matter transpar and homogen in procedur speed and limit restructur prior to privat lead to better outcom and less room for corrupt and discret final privat s success is enhanc by two complementari polici deregul or reregul of industri previous shield from competit forc and an effect corpor govern framework that facilit privat firm  access to capit at lower cost overal the empir record show that privat lead to increas profit and product firm restructur fiscal benefit output growth and even qualiti improv most case of privat failur can be link to poor contract design opaqu process with heavi state involv lack of reregul and a poor corpor govern framework", "title": "Privatization in Latin America: What Does the Evidence Say?"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v114y1999i4p1193-1242..html": {"abstract": "Critics of privatization argue that the increased profitability of privatized companies comes at the expense of society.
