Finally, a UTR may tie the hands of a future government expected to favor certain sectors over others, and enhance welfare ex ante. None of these presents an air-tight case for uniformity.

These features create a potential conflict to the extent that traditional notions of comparative advantage would lead us to expect that the modern sectors will be squeezed with liberalization. In this paper we investigate the issue by using an applied general equilibrium model calibrated to Cameroonian data. Under perfect competition, the traditional expectations are borne out: manufacturing sectors on the whole contract, and the cash crops sector (mainly coffee and cocoa) is the main beneficiary; the welfare effect is a wash since the beneficial consequence of expanded imports is offset by labor being pulled away from the modern, high-wage sectors. By contrast, under imperfect competition (in the modern sectors only), trade liberalization produces welfare gains of the order of 1 to 2 percent of real income. The key is the pro-competitive effect of liberalization: domestic firms now perceive themselves as facing a higher elasticity of demand, which spurs them to increase production. Therefore, the modern sectors do much better in terms of output than in the perfectly competitive benchmark. The introduction of scale economies amplifies these results. Under reasonable circumstances imperfect competition will make liberalization more desirable, even in the absence of firm entry and exit.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epro60"], "abstractStem": "how like is trade liber to produc effici gain in the presenc of imperfect competit scale economi and higherthanaverag wage in the modern sector  all common featur of develop economi these featur creat a potenti conflict to the extent that tradit notion of compar advantag would lead us to expect that the modern sector will be squeez with liber in thi paper we investig the issu by use an appli gener equilibrium model calibr to cameroonian data under perfect competit the tradit expect are born out manufactur sector on the whole contract and the cash crop sector mainli coffe and cocoa is the main beneficiari the welfar effect is a wash sinc the benefici consequ of expand import is offset by labor be pull away from the modern highwag sector by contrast under imperfect competit in the modern sector onli trade liber produc welfar gain of the order of 1 to 2 percent of real incom the key is the procompetit effect of liber domest firm now perceiv themselv as face a higher elast of demand which spur them to increas product therefor the modern sector do much better in term of output than in the perfectli competit benchmark the introduct of scale economi amplifi these result under reason circumst imperfect competit will make liber more desir even in the absenc of firm entri and exitpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Pro-competitive effects of trade reform : Results from a CGE model of Cameroon"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v95y2005i2p50-55.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epro60", "epwa67"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Do Democratic Transitions Produce Bad Economic Outcomes?"}, "firstname": "Dani", "https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/jpolrf/v1y1996i1p1-2.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["eppa82", "epro60"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Editors' introduction"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/cai/rpvedb/rpve_412_0041.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epro60"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Le commerce des illusions"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v34y1990i1-2p329-338.html": {"abstract": "The author's model demonstrates that when imports are predominantly intermediate inputs - as they are in most developing countries - import restrictions can not always be relied upon to improve the trade balance.

Consider then Gary Shteyngart's timely comic novel \"Super Sad True Love Story\" (Random House, 2010), which provides a rather graphic vision of what lies in store for the world economy. The novel takes place in the near future and is set against the backdrop of a United States that lies in economic and political ruin. The country's bankrupt economy is ruled with a firm hand by the IMF from its new Parthenon-shaped headquarters in Singapore. China and sovereign wealth funds have parceled America's most desirable real estate among themselves. Poor people are designated as LNWI (\"low net worth individuals\") and are being pushed into ghettoes. Even skilled Americans are desperate to acquire residency status in foreign lands. This is sheer fantasy of course, but one that seems to resonate well with the collective mood. A future in which the U.S and other advanced economies are forced to play second fiddle to the dynamic emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere is rapidly becoming cliche. This vision is based in part on the very rapid pace of economic growth that emerging and developing economies experienced in the run-up to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Latin America benefited from a pace of economic development that it had not experienced since the 1970s, and Africa began to close the gap with the advanced countries for the first time since countries in the continent received their independence. Even though most of these countries were hit badly by the crisis, their recovery has also been swift. Optimism on developing countries is matched by pessimism on the rich country front. The United States and Europe have emerged from the crisis with debilitating challenges. They need to address a crushing debt burden and its unpleasant implications for fiscal and monetary policy.

Dealing with economic insecurity would thus appear to be a key part of the unfinished agenda of Latin America's reforms. The author argues that economic insecurity in Latin America is multifaceted and has many sources that feed on each other. Some of the insecurity arises from the decline in employment protection and increased volatility of household outcomes. Some of it is the result of erratic capital flows and the systemic instability generated by a divorce between the instruments of stabilization and the real economy. Finally, an important component is the weakness of the institutions of voice and representation. Programmes aimed at social protection per se can be of partial help only. They will have to be complemented by applying macroeconomic policies, especially with regard to capital flows and the exchange rate, that are more conducive to the stability of the real economy and by loosening the control of financial markets over the instruments of macroeconomic policy. They will also require access to representative institutions -trade unions, political parties, and legislatures- with greater responsiveness and legitimacy than those that exist at present. But perhaps what Latin America needs most is a vision of how social cohesion can be maintained in the face of large inequalities and volatile outcomes, both of which are being aggravated by the growing reliance on market forces.

In most prevailing theories of policy choice, the dominant role is instead played by \"vested interests\"?elites, lobbies, and rent-seeking groups which get their way at the expense of the general public. Any model of political economy in which organized interests do not figure prominently is likely to remain vacuous and incomplete. But it does not follow from this that interests are the ultimate determinant of political outcomes. Here I will challenge the notion that there is a well-defined mapping from \"interests\" to outcomes. This mapping depends on many unstated assumptions about the ideas that political agents have about: 1) what they are maximizing, 2) how the world works, and 3) the set of tools they have at their disposal to further their interests. Importantly, these ideas are subject to both manipulation and innovation, making them part of the political game. There is, in fact, a direct parallel, as I will show, between inventive activity in technology, which economists now routinely make endogenous in their models, and investment in persuasion and policy innovation in the political arena. I focus specifically on models professing to explain economic inefficiency and argue that outcomes in such models are determined as much by the ideas that elites are presumed to have on feasible strategies as by vested interests themselves. A corollary is that new ideas about policy?or policy entrepreneurship?can exert an independent effect on equilibrium outcomes even in the absence of changes in the configuration of political power.

However recent research revealed that they do not necessarily lead to higher growth and employment rates. Recent studies, drawing on data from developing countries, showed that only the \"right\" kind of productivity growth resulted in higher employment rates. Enterprises in Africa and Latin America caught up in matters of technology; however, this process resulted in a substitution of employment by technology. The same is true for structural change; only the \"right\" kind of structural change caused more growth and employment. Whereas in Asia, labour shifted from the less productive agricultural sector to more productive sectors, in Africa and Latin America, labour switched from a relatively productive agricultural sector to even less productive informal sectors. Thus, policies have to focus on promoting the \"right\" kind of productivity growth and structural change. Possible means to this end could be avoiding an over-valuation of the local currency, as well as protecting local infant industries.

I consider an economy with two sectors: a high-productivity private sector, which initially employs a small share of the economy's work-force, and a low-productivity state sector, where the majority of the population is employed at the outset. In the early stages of the transition, the private sector expands at a rate that is lower than the rate at which the state sector is contracting, with the result that unemployment first rises and then falls. The government's policy consists of a subsidy to the state sector, which has the effect of slowing down the transition. The analysis focuses on the dynamic evolution of workers' preferences over the level of the subsidy. A worker in the private sector always prefers the lowest possible subsidy to the state sector. The same is true of an unemployed worker as well, as the subsidy only reduces the number of new jobs created without reducing the number of job seekers. But state-sector workers have ambiguous feelings over reform strategy and their preferences change over time. In particular, even if state-sector workers prefer shock therapy at the outset, they will always want to slow the reforms down at a later stage. The reason is that the probability of finding a higher-paying private-sector job declines as the transition unfolds.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epro60"], "abstractStem": "thi paper consid a simpl model of econom transit to analys the dynam of prefer over econom polici i consid an economi with two sector a highproduct privat sector which initi employ a small share of the economi workforc and a lowproduct state sector where the major of the popul is employ at the outset in the earli stage of the transit the privat sector expand at a rate that is lower than the rate at which the state sector is contract with the result that unemploy first rise and then fall the govern polici consist of a subsidi to the state sector which ha the effect of slow down the transit the analysi focus on the dynam evolut of worker prefer over the level of the subsidi a worker in the privat sector alway prefer the lowest possibl subsidi to the state sector the same is true of an unemploy worker as well as the subsidi onli reduc the number of new job creat without reduc the number of job seeker but statesector worker have ambigu feel over reform strategi and their prefer chang over time in particular even if statesector worker prefer shock therapi at the outset they will alway want to slow the reform down at a later stage the reason is that the probabl of find a higherpay privatesector job declin as the transit unfoldspthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "The Dynamics of Political Suppport for Reform in Economies in Transition"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/col/000425/008659.html": {"abstract": "We study the causes of low growth in El Salvador, a country with an impressive record of political, macroeconomic, and structural reform.

In fact, growth rates typically return to their levels before the transition within a decade. By contrast, countries that undergo growth transition-arising from improved terms of trade, increased domestic investment, or other sources-do end up with permanently higher saving rates.

For this purpose, an index is used which measures the degree to which each country displays this type of export mix. This is an idiosyncratic phenomenon which seems to be linked with the capacity to undertake the production and export of new products. There is therefore a place for incentive policies, accompanied by the ability of the government to recognize failed attempts and to stop subsidizing them.

We review this literature and find it unconvincing. The underlying assumptions in this literature are that developing countries are savings-constrained; that access to foreign finance alleviates this to boost investment and long-run growth; and that insofar as there are problems with financial globalization, these can be remedied through deep institutional reforms. In contrast, we argue that developing economies are as or more likely to be investment- than savings-constrained and that the effect of foreign finance is often to aggravate this investment constraint by appreciating the real exchange rate and reducing profitability and investment opportunities in the traded goods sector, which have adverse long-run growth consequences. It is time for a new paradigm on financial globalization, and one that recognizes that more is not necessarily better. Depending on context and country, the appropriate role of policy will be as often to stem the tide of capital inflows as to encourage them. Policymakers who view their challenges exclusively from the latter perspective risk getting it badly wrong.
