Although these factors are most commonly considered as independent influences, we argue after critically outlining views about the two first mentioned factors, that strong interdependence exists between these influences. The article then examines potential policy responses to this growing inequality. Protectionism, increased provision of education and skill-enhancement, greater compensation via social services for the disadvantaged and negative income-tax systems are examined as possibilities. These policies are all found to have limited ability to address the problem. Ability to implement several of these policies may be severely restricted by international fiscal competitiveness.

First, diversity of relevant attributes driving the dynamics of socioeconomic systems, including industrial systems'is often needed to increase their likelihood of transiting to a superior state. However, systems left to their own devices do not always evolve to states where they possess sufficient or optimal diversity for further evolution or growth to a superior state. Evolutionary market mechanisms can be of this nature. Structural adjustment policies and globalization seem to be adding to industrial and other types of uniformity. Hence, real danger exists that global industrial structures influenced by field effects will become \"piled up\" and reduce the likelihood of the global economic system evolving to a superior economic state. Furthermore, diversity is an important driving force in other growth processes, e.g., those adding to the stock of knowledge. Second industrial diversity of techniques and behaviors may be potentially Paretian valuable as a means of optimal adjustment to continual technological change and as a manifestation of specialization according to differences in individual abilities and in those of organizations. Insofar as attempts at benchmarking try to ensure uniform adoption of \"best practice\" in industry, they are likely to be doubly damaging because short-run potential Paretian benefits are forgone, and in stifling industrial diversity they may also undermine industrial diversity as a source of future economic growth.

But for a considerable period in the past, economists stressed the importance of the accumulation of man-made physical capital for economic growth and development, to the neglect of human resource capital. Nevertheless, in the second half of the 20th century the importance of human resource capital (particularly education) for economic growth came to be recognised. Nevertheless, the implications of the formation of human resource capital for sustainable development were given virtually no in-depth attention but it is important to address this matter, as is done here. The nature and broad categories of capital are outlined and particular attention is given to human resource capital. While the formation of human resource capital can support sustainable development, it also poses a challenge since this \"formation\" draws on or transforms natural resource and environmental capital. Using a neo-Malthusian model, direct routes by which investment in human resource capital may promote sustainable development are outlined. Both improved education and health are likely, for example, to reduce population growth and this is likely to have favourable consequences for sustainable development. The provision of sufficient human capital for females is shown to be crucial in this respect. Nonetheless, it must also be recognised that difficulties (some of which are outlined) exist for sustainably developing human resources. It is argued that greater equality in the distribution of human resource capital, both within nations and globally, would make a significant contribution to sustainable development.

Economists have, therefore, given increasing attention to the policy issues involved in the management of genetic resources. To do so, they often apply empirical methods developed in behavioral and experimental economics to estimate economic values placed on genetic resources. This trend away from almost exclusive dependence on axiomatic methods is welcomed. However, major valuation methods used in behavioral economics raise new scientific challenges. Possibly the most important of these include deficiencies in the knowledge of the public (and researchers) about genetic resources, implications for the formation of values of supplying information to focal individuals, and limits to rationality.These issues are explored for stated-preference techniques of valuation (e.g., contingent valuation) as well as revealed preference techniques, especially the travel cost method.

Sea-level rise is one consequence of particular concern to Pacific Island states. It also reviews the views of economists about connections between economic growth and global warming. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 International efforts, such as through the Kyoto protocol, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their atmospheric concentration are discussed and prospects for post-Kyoto policies are considered. Ways are also examined of addressing the consequences of global warming for the Pacific Island states. How they will be affected and to what extent is discussed, together with their ability to cope with the emerging problem. Findings \u2013 The paper finds that whereas the majority of economists did not foresee a conflict between economic growth and global warming, the possibility of such a conflict is now more widely recognized following the Stern Report. It is predicted that a significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future owing to conflicting national interest (a prisoners' dilemma problem) and because is will take time to develop new technologies which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, payment for greenhouse gas emissions (for example, via tradable permits) will accelerate desirable technological advance. Both international political action and efforts to develop and use technologies that lower greenhouse gas emissions need to be pursued.

The results suggest that consumers' surplus is much greater than it would have been had the high yielding crop varieties ( HYVs) not been introduced. By keeping the real price lower than it would have been otherwise, the modern varieties have tended to be income equalizing for urban consumers. The Hayami-Herdt partial model even suggests that, given the relatively inelastic demand for rice in Bangladesh, the real cash income of producers has risen slightly as a result of these new technologies. In reality, however, the impact of these changes on incomes of farmers and the distribution of income between those involved in production is more complex. It is suggested that if a less partial view is taken and if account is taken of lower cost of obtaining home-consumed produce, the increase in income may be greater. In any event, there are dangers in using such a partial model to predict the developmental consequences of technological changes affecting a staple crop, and attention needs also to be given to the possibility that the supply curve may not have the simple form and pivot in the way supposed by Hayami and Herdt. While the Hayami-Herdt model is simple to apply, it is best used as a first approximation or starting point rather than a final solution. It ignores a number of criteria that could be important in assessing new agricultural technologies, such as their impact on the variability of benefits to producers and consumers and their consequences for sustainability of production. Furthermore, the Hay-ami-Herdt model does not deal specifically with changes in factor shares in farm production.

This lack of sensitivity has had unfortunate social and ecological consequences for some communities in, for example, the Russian Federation and for subsistence agriculturalists in some less developed countries. The evolution of globalised market systems involving industrial/commercial agriculture (largely dependent on inputs external to the farm) under the \"patronage\" of oligopolistic suppliers is seen to increasingly threaten the balance between social and ecological systems and as undermining the sustainability of both.

This is an important matter because the fertility rate in Kenya is high; higher than in most developing countries. It is especially high in rural areas. This may be an impediment to Kenya's development. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 First relevant economic literature is reviewed to identify factors that economists and others claim are important influences on family size. Then follows a case study of families in the Nyeri district of Kenya. Data are obtained from a random sample of households in this district using a semi-structured questionnaire in direct interviews. The survey results are summarised and then analysed using Tobit analysis and least squares regression. Findings \u2013 Both economic and social/cultural factors are found to be important influences on family size. For example, preference for male children has an important positive influence on family size in the Nyeri district. Women are found to prefer male offspring to daughters, possibly because they are afraid of being disinherited if they do not produce a male heir for their husbands. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Support for the conclusions reached could be strengthened or further assessed by increasing the sample size in the Nyeri district and be conducting similar surveys in other rural districts of Kenya. Practical implications \u2013 Introducing social security systems in Kenya to assist the elderly and the infirm would reduce the need for Kenyan women to have many children as security and women should be granted greater inheritance rights, especially to land. Furthermore, education of women should be promoted as a way to reduce family size.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Using economic analysis, this paper outlines and illustrates the basis of the economics of parental discrimination against female children and structured questionnaires are used to collect data from village rural wives in the Santal tribal belt of West Bengal and in Orissa in Kondh-dominated village to determine the extent to which economics explains parental discrimination between daughters and sons. The selection of the areas has been done on the basis that their different cultural dimensions may affect parental attitudes to female children. The statistical significance of differences in responses between the West Bengal sample and that from Orissa is tested using the chi-squared test. Implications of the results for theory of parental discrimination between siblings according to their gender are outlined. Findings \u2013 It is found that parental discrimination in favour of boys and against girls is much more marked in the Santal-dominated belt of West Bengal than in the Kondh-dominated villages of Orissa, where it is absent or virtually so. This is the case despite similar economic conditions and the fact that all the sampled villagers are relatively poor. Differences in cultural values seem to explain the difference. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Results could be strengthened by using a similar questionnaire to survey wives in additional villages in the Santal tribal-belt of West Bengal and in more Kondh-dominated villages in Orissa, as well as in other cultural contexts. Furthermore, families in these areas are patriarchal. It would be interesting to obtain results also from Indian communities that have matriarchal families as in parts of Meghalaya. Originality/value \u2013 The findings support the view that the behaviour of parents towards children (according to their gender or otherwise) is a combined result of personal parental goals, social structures and cultural values.

These macroeconomic tensions are illustrated using Australian perspectives. The deregulation of the Australian financial markets has increased capital mobility and profoundly changed Australia\u2019s macroeconomic policy landscape over the past two decades. Financial deregulation has been propelled by the symbiotic processes of trade liberalisation, technological change and financial innovation. Although the measurement of the degree of capital mobility is shrouded in theoretical controversy, empirical evidence clearly reveals the trends in increased capital mobility and reduction of country risk premia, despite the rise in currency risk premia confounding the achievement of real interest parity. The phenomenon of financial integration has changed profoundly the policy targets and the mechanics underpirining the operation of policy transmission channels. Arguably, the recent emphasis of inflation targeting by reinforcing central bank independence is partly in deference to the short-term policy priorities of the international financial markets, thereby downgrading traditional policy concerns for unemployment reduction and long-term growth. The case for throwing sands on the wheels of international finance to ~~gain macroeconomic policy control appears to be counterproductive from an efficiency perspective. Nonetheless, there is a strong case for reviewing profound changes that have occurred in Australia\u2019s financial landscapes due to financial deregulation and international integration. These changes have enhanced the exposure of the financial system to systemic risk, information asymmetry, product convergence, institutional conglomeration and anti-competitive mergers. Financial integration whilst conferring the dynamic benefits of economies of scale and scope through competition has increased the vulnerability of the financial system to risks and macroeconomic instability. Therefore, the Wallis Committee (1996) appointed by the government is opportune and will examine any market distortions inherent in current regulatory structures and recommend the establishment of an internationally best practice regulatory framework to enable the Australian traders, investors to compete efficiently in the emergent borderless financial world.

They are often seen as a very effective way of maintaining environmental conditions in a desired way. However, considerable care is required in adopting such systems. If they are inappropriately designed, the government will lose its flexibility to control the state of the environment. Permits which give their owners absolute rights to emit certain quantities of pollution in perpetuity or entitle holders to use or appropriate a particular quantity of a natural resource in perpetuity can cause particular problems for government. They can for example, involve expensive buy-back schemes. There are, however, ways around the problem. Furthermore, holders of rights may have to pay fees to cover enforcement costs. Where tradeable permits have a very long life, the question arises of how they should be allocated and whether those allocated these rights should be allowed to capture the rents. As discussed, changing ambient conditions may have to be allowed for in designing systems involving tradeable permits. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": " there ha been a recent tendenc to extol tradeabl or market pollut permit or similar permit to use or exploit some natur resourc such as fish they are often seen as a veri effect way of maintain environment condit in a desir way howev consider care is requir in adopt such system if they are inappropri design the govern will lose it flexibl to control the state of the environ permit which give their owner absolut right to emit certain quantiti of pollut in perpetu or entitl holder to use or appropri a particular quantiti of a natur resourc in perpetu can caus particular problem for govern they can for exampl involv expens buyback scheme there are howev way around the problem furthermor holder of right may have to pay fee to cover enforc cost where tradeabl permit have a veri long life the question aris of how they should be alloc and whether those alloc these right should be allow to captur the rent as discuss chang ambient condit may have to be allow for in design system involv tradeabl permit   1998 john wiley amp son ltd and erp environ", "title": "Economic policy instruments and environmental sustainability: another look at environmental-use permits"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v31y1999i3p395-408.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Carrying capacity reconsidered: from Malthus' population theory to cultural carrying capacity"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v2y1990i1p77-90.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Economics and the debate about preservation of species, crop varieties and genetic diversity"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfpoli/v12y1987i4p318-331.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["fpal298", "epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Trends and projections for Bangladeshi food production : An alternative viewpoint"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecorec/v49y1973i127p447-55.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Non-marginal Externalities: As Relevant and As Not"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecorec/v52y1976i140p513-14.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The Distribution of Research Grants: A Rejoinder"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/ags/remaae/9214.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epti17"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Rejoinder On The Nerlove-Waugh Advertising Theorem"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/pio/envirc/v20y2002i5p699-716.html": {"abstract": "The authors discuss the regulation of rural land use and compensation for property-rights restrictions, both of which appear to have become more commonplace in recent years but also more contested. The implications of contemporary theories in relation to this matter are examined, including: the applicability of new welfare economics; the relevance of the neoclassical theory of politics; and the implications of contemporary theories of social conflict resolution and communication. Examination of examples of Swiss and Australian regulation of the use of rural properties, and the ensuing conflicts, reveals that many decisions reflect a mixture of these elements. Rarely, if ever, are social decisions in this area made solely on the basis of welfare economics, for instance social cost - benefit analysis. Only some aspects of such decisions can be explained by the neoclassical theory of politics. Theories of social conflict resolution suggest why, and in what way, approaches of discourse and participation may resolve conflicts regarding regulation and compensation. These theories and their practical application seem to gain in importance as opposition to government decisions increases. The high degree of complexity of most conflicts concerning regulation and compensation cannot be tackled with narrow economic theories.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The trends in women's workforce participation, educational attainments and earnings compared with those of men are evaluated on the basis of descriptive statistics. Correlation and regression techniques are used to examine the relationship between women's education and workforce participation, and to predict the equalisation of female-male educational attainment. Findings \u2013 The study finds evidence of growing commercialisation of women's work in Bangladesh. Although most women in the workforce are self-employed or employed in low-skill jobs, their participation in high skill and entrepreneurial jobs as well as policy-making bodies is on the rise. While gender wage differentials have been considerably reduced in many industries, in general, women tend to be paid less than men. There have been remarkable improvements in women's educational attainments. Further, female education is found to be positively correlated with their workforce participation. Overall, the findings indicate an improvement in women's status in Bangladesh. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The suggested relationship between women's education and employment needs to be further investigated using rigorous econometric techniques in order to distinguish between productivity-enhancing effects of education and other determinants of increased female employment (FEMPL). Practical implications \u2013 The research should be a useful reference to international and domestic policy-makers as well as members of the academia and future researchers on the issue.

ARDL estimates indicate a significant long-run positive relationship between economic growth and internet usage. No significant relationship is found between economic growth and social capital in both the short- and the long-run. However, the interaction term of internet usage and social capital has a significant positive association with economic growth both in the short- and long-run. The short-run relationship between economic growth and internet usage is insignificant. A bidirectional causal link exists between internet usage and economic growth and between the interaction variable and economic growth. Unidirectional causality runs from internet usage to the interaction variable. No causal relation is found between social capital and economic growth. The findings are also supported by applications of a different econometric method, namely dynamic ordinary least squares estimation.
