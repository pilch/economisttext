This suggests that less attention should be focused on the general question whether a floating or a fixed exchange rate is preferable, and more on these deeper institutional arrangements.

The Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias (CEEY) brought together a group of experts in financial systems and public finance to debate the origin of the above-mentioned financial crises and the viability of means for anticipating them. This is particularly important since the environment in which we now find ourselves is one where technical advances and financial innovations are themselves a source of risk; this is because the speed of development often outstrips the capacity of regulators and financial supervisors to keep abreast of them. The experts also analyzed the responses of the respective authorities to the two crises, their effectiveness and alternative strategies that might have been applied.

The basic intuition is provided by the bank-run literature of the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) variety. Financial development is modeled as a mechanism that endows real assets (e.g., land and capital) with liquidity. However, liquidity can be impaired by shocks that are equivalent to a bank run. Liquidity creation enhances real asset prices, while a liquidity crunch generates asset price collapse. This bubble-looking episode is not driven by standard fundamentals, although it is fully in line with rationality. In this context, devoid of other frictions like price stickiness, the note examines the effect of monetary policy in the absence of nominal rigidities. It shows that preventing price deflation is not enough to offset relative (to output) asset price meltdown, but lower policy interest rates increase relative asset prices and steady-state output. Moreover, in the neighborhood of a first-best capital allocation, an increase in the liquidity of capital may lower the welfare of the representative individual, even if the higher liquidity of capital is sustainable and, hence, not destroyed by future crash \u2013 illustrating the possibility of \u201cexcessive\u201d financial innovation.

I argue that financial and liquidity considerations--as opposed to current account sustainability or real exchange rate considerations--appear to have played a prominent role. Special attention is given to financial factors in Latin America. On this basis it is concluded that Mexico and Argentina were particularly vulnerable to speculative attacks. For contrast, the experience of Austria is examined and compared with that of Mexico. The analysis suggests that the remarkable stability of Austria--which pegged its currency to the Deutsche Mark for more than 15 years--may be due to the low volatility of its monetary aggregates. I also argue that financial factors could account for multiple self-fulfilling equilibria, helping to explain the sudden and deep reversals in Mexico and Argentina. It concludes with a discussion on policy implications. I suggest that, aside from the usual fiscal prudence advice, countries should pay special attention to the banking system and the maturity of public debt. Furthermore, the appropriateness of an exchange rate regime should take into account the characteristics of the financial sector. Copyright @ 1996 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
