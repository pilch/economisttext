Here we consider alternative linear estimators that are designed to improve the properties of the standard first-differenced GMM estimator. We consider two approaches to estimation. The first approach extends the model by adding the observed initial values as an extra regressor. This allows consistent estimates to be obtained by error-components GLS. This estimator is shown to be equivalent to the optimal GMM estimator for the normal homoskedastic error components model. The second approach considers a mild restriction on the initial condition process under which lagged differences in the dependent variable can be used to construct linear moment conditions in the levels equations. The complete set of moment conditions can then be exploited by a linear GMM estimator in a system of first-differenced and levels equations, rendering the non-linear moment conditions redundant for estimation. This estimator is strictly more efficient than non-linear GMM when the additional restriction is valid.

[eng] Estimation of a Comprehensive System of Goods Demand and Labour Supply for a Sample of French Households, by Richard Blundell, Fran\u00e7ois Laisney and Matthias Ruth. In order to obtain a comprehensive demand system compatible with life-cycle decisions, previously obtained estimation results for the married-woman labour supply are used to identify the virtually homothetic preference parameters defined for 16 categories of goods estimated for a sample of married-couple households taken from the INSEE Budget des Familles 1978-1979 survey. Four systems are differentiated according to whether or not the household reports purchases in the tobacco and alcohol categories. The other possible zero outlays are treated as resulting from the \"purchase infrequency\" phenomenon. Minimal consumption is parameterized in great detail according to socio-demographic characteristics, by placintg the emphasis on a symmetrical handling of the characteristics of the husband and the wife. Diagnoses of the hypothesis of the separability of leisure and goods preferences, on which the adopted estimation strategy is based, clearly reject the hypothesis for the four goods categories of \"clothing dans shoes\", \"durables\", \"transport and communication\" and \"VAT-reduced rate services\". This result could be due to the existence of fixed business costs for these goods categories.

[eng] Labour Supply and Taxation: A Survey, by Richard Blundell. This review shows how important the behaviour of the labour supply is in the economic evaluation of tax reforms. An evaluation of agents' reactions can be made by looking at the radical measures taken by the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The behaviour of married women is most sensitive to changes in taxation. However, several other groups are also marked by considerable variations in family income and by sizeable marginal changes in income.

It concerns inference about a non-parametric function g that is identified by a conditional moment restriction involving instrumental variables (IV). A test of the hypothesis that g is the mean of a random variable Y conditional on a covariate X is developed that is not subject to the ill-posed inverse problem of non-parametric IV estimation. The test is consistent whenever g differs from E (Y \u2223 X) on a set of non-zero probability. The usefulness of this new exogeneity test is displayed through Monte Carlo experiments and an application to estimation of non-parametric consumer expansion paths.
