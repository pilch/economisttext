The New Economic Geography, now middle-aged, Regional Studies. This paper claims that the New Economic Geography has now become 'middle-aged'. On the one hand, the New Economic Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that recent developments in developing economies like China are quite in line with the core-periphery model that predicts increasing regional specialization as a result of economic integration. Although both economists and geographers study these spatial processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected because of the use of different methodologies. [image omitted] Krugman P. La nouvelle geographie economique atteint l'age mur, Regional Studies. Cet article pretend que la nouvelle geographie economique atteint 'l'age mur'. D'un cote, on dit que la nouvelle geographie economique est peu pertinente quant aux developpements des economies avancees parce qu'elle porte plutot sur les causes manifestes de la concentration geographique des activites economiques que sur les sources indefinissables, telles les retombees de l'information. De l'autre cote, l'article affirme que des developpements recents dans les economies avancees, voire la Chine, sont tout a fait en accord avec le modele du centre-peripherie, qui prevoit une augmentation de la specialisation regionale suite a l'integration economique. Bien que les economistes et les geographes etudient ces processus geographiques, on n'attend aucun debat constructif a cause des methodologies differentes. Nouvelle geographie economique Agglomeration Regions Commerce international Krugman P. Die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie - inzwischen im mittleren Alter, Regional Studies. In diesem Beitrag wird die These aufgestellt, dass sich die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie inzwischen im mittleren Alter befindet. Einerseits gilt die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie als weniger relevant zur Beschreibung von aktuellen Entwicklungen in den Industriestaaten, weil sie sich starker auf die greifbaren Ursachen der raumlichen Konzentration von Wirtschaftsaktivitaten und weniger auf nicht greifbare Quellen wie z.\ufffdB. Informationsubertragungen konzentriert. Andererseits wird in diesem Beitrag festgestellt, dass die jungsten Entwicklungen in Schwellenlandern wie China durchaus dem Kern-Peripherie-Modell entsprechen, in dem eine hohere regionale Spezialisierung als Ergebnis einer wirtschaftlichen Integration prognostiziert wird. Obwohl diese raumlichen Prozesse sowohl von Okonomen als auch von Geografen untersucht werden, ist aufgrund der Verwendung unterschiedlicher Methodologien kein fruchtbarer Austausch zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen zu erwarten.

Moreover, split-the-difference tax harmonization can make both nations worse off. This may help explain why tax harmonisation which is Pareto improving in the standard model is so difficult in the real world. The key theoretical insight is that agglomeration forces create quasi-rents that can be taxed without inducing delocation. This suggests that the tax game is something subtler than a race to the bottom. Advanced 'core' nations may act like limit-pricing monopolists toward less advanced 'periphery' countries.

If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss in the hope that the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post-1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epkr10"], "abstractStem": "thi paper examin the tradeoff face creditor of a countri whose debt is larg enough that the countri cannot attract voluntari new lend if the countri is unabl to meet it debt servic requir out of current incom the creditor have two choic they can financ the countri lend at an expect loss in the hope that the countri will eventu be abl to repay it debt after all or they can forgiv reduc the debt level to one that the countri can repay the post1983 debt strategi of the imf and the us ha reli on financ but mani current call for debt reform call for forgiv instead the paper show that the choic between financ and forgiv repres a tradeoff financ give the creditor an option valu if the countri turn out to do rel well creditor will not have written down their claim unnecessarili howev the burden of debt distort the countri incent sinc the benefit of good perform go larg to creditor rather than itself the paper also show that the tradeoff itself can be improv if both financ and forgiv are made conting on state of natur that the countri cannot affect such as oil price world interest rate etcpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Financing vs. forgiving a debt overhang"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v15y1984i1984-1p77-132.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epkr10"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "The U.S. Response to Foreign Industrial Targeting"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/emx/esteco/v3y1988i2p149-167.html": {"abstract": "No abstract is available for this item.", "authors": ["epkr10"], "abstractStem": "no abstract is avail for thi item", "title": "Desindustrializaci\u00f3n, reindustrializaci\u00f3n y tipo de cambio real"}, "https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v99y2009i3p561-71.html": {"abstract": "Thirty years have passed since a small group of theorists began applying concepts and tools from industrial organization to the analysis of international trade.

At lower trade barriers agglomeration forces dominate and the equilibrium involves specialization, with each industry concentrated in a single location. Economic integration may induce specialization. The paper studies the simple dynamics of the model and demonstrates that during the adjustment process a sizeable proportion of the labour force may suffer lower real wages as relocation of industry occurs, although there are long-run gains from integration.<p>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)", "authors": ["epkr10", "epve7"], "abstractStem": "the paper consid the equilibrium locat of two industri in two countri both industri are imperfectli competit and produc good which are use in final consumpt and as intermedi by firm in the same industri intermedi usag creat cost and demand linkag between firm and a tendenc for agglomer of each industri when trade barrier are high the equilibrium involv divis of both industri between both locat in order to meet the final demand of consum at lower trade barrier agglomer forc domin and the equilibrium involv special with each industri concentr in a singl locat econom integr may induc special the paper studi the simpl dynam of the model and demonstr that dure the adjust process a sizeabl proport of the labour forc may suffer lower real wage as reloc of industri occur although there are longrun gain from integrationpthi abstract wa borrow from anoth version of thi item", "title": "Integration, specialization, and adjustment"}}}
