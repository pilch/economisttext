By creating a strong, independent central bank at the european level, facing multiple country-level fiscal authorities, the threat of political pressures for inflationary finance would be lower than with individual country central banks. We are learning that this formerly conventional view was largely mistaken. In particular, the euro as originally structured seemed to require the elimination of national-level lender of last resort functions for central banks, without creating as strong a replacement at the european level. Having discovered these gaps through experience, what options are there going forward for the euro area? A solution would be to fill in the institutional gaps in the original euro framework.
